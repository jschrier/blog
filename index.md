I like to learn things by building small projects.
In addition to [my scholarly research in chemistry](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=zJC_7roAAAAJ&hl=en) I am generally interested in probability, geometry, optimization, programming topics, and machine-learning problems.
For several years I have kept private electronic [wastebooks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waste_book) of my explorations, but these are increasingly useful for my students.
I've also increasingly enjoyed reading other people's blogs in this vein, so this is my attempt to share some of the fruits of these considerations.
No attempt is made at novelty or scholarly completeness; these are just haphazard notes.
