A classic Obamapunk[^1] 2012 New Yorker article by Atul Gawande[^2] compares [healthcare (unfavorably) to the Cheesecake Factory restaurant chain](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2012/08/13/big-med). Whereas the Cheesecake Factory delivers a panopoly of items to every taste, prepared from fresh ingredients to order,  achieving economies of scale in training and waste prevention by training, performance evaluation, and data analytics, the American Healthcare System squanders resources by failing to use the centralized employement of hospital systems to enforce standardized practices amongst its physicians (a few exceptions prove the rule).  **Some reflections on how this relates to higher education (another sector of reluctant "employees" and spiralling costs)...**

The tendency of the modern university is to offer a variety of courses and majors, and the trend seems to be to [dilute the idea of the core curriculum](https://thefordhamram.com/91735/opinion/core-curriculum/). You can be a hardcore dedicated scholar, or sail through in "Easy-A" programs of study. That is, like the Cheesecake factory, we offer:
```
...three hundred and eight dinner items (including the forty-nine on the “Skinnylicious” menu), plus a hundred and twenty-four choices of beverage. It’s a linen-napkin-and-tablecloth sort of place, but with something for everyone. There’s wine and wasabi-crusted ahi tuna, but there’s also buffalo wings and Bud Light. The kids ordered mostly comfort food—pot stickers, mini crab cakes, teriyaki chicken, Hawaiian pizza, pasta carbonara. I got a beet salad with goat cheese, white-bean hummus and warm flatbread, and the miso salmon.
