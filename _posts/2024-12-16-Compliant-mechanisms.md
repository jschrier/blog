[Jay Hineman](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=cmdgvoUAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao) reminded me about the coolness of [compliant mechanisms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compliant_mechanism), which use elastic deformation to achieve force and motion transmission---they're also naturals for 3d-printing.  Some resources...

# Learning resources

- [Jonathan Hopkins' (UCLA) video series](https://www.youtube.com/@TheFACTsofMechanicalDesign) -- several playlists to choose from
- Howell et al, [Handbook of Compliant Mechanisms](https://amzn.to/3ZWMe6G)

# Fun things to print

- [impressive compliant blaster](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Y1OKlcw78g):  definitely follow the instructions and print with 0.15 mm resolution; it works better that way, as the fits will be smoother
- [flaming matchstick compliant crossbow](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gUvTxCBWYM0)
- [3d printed nerf gun](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O33g62Kwq9s)
- [print in place toggle](https://makerworld.com/en/models/467451#profileId-376540)
