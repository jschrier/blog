*Premise*: (Inspired by a visit to the [Ringling Museum's collection...](https://www.ringling.org/event/mountains-of-the-mind-scholars-rocks-from-china-and-beyond/)) A study of the geochemistry, cultural history, and aesthetics of [Scholar's Rocks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gongshi) (*Gongshi*) (also Korean [suseok](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suseok)) and Japanese [suiseki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suiseki), with a dose of 3d-printing and sculptural practice.  A framework to think about issues of generative/AI artwork, the boundary between human practice, nature, and chance in art, etc.  **Topics include...**

# Some discussion topics

- History of gongshi, etc.
- Aesthetic theories of gongshi
    - Gongshi as a subject for painting, including [contemporary movements](https://intellectdiscover.com/
content/journals/10.1386/jcca.1.2-2.215_1)
    - Gongshi as a proto-[readymade](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Readymades_of_Marcel_Duchamp), with reference back to Duchamp's art meta-project of curation and taste
    - How does this relate to generative AI as a natural process that creates items that are human-curated and modified?
    - 
- Geochemistry: How is it that natural rocks are formed?  Basic [petrology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petrology)
- Computational sculpture and generative design, in the [flavor of Mandelbrot](https://amzn.to/3RRgI5H)---posit some simple generative processes and see what looks cool.  Maybe this is a way to sneak some computer programming into the course 

# Some activities

- [Mohs rock hardness tests](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mohs_scale)
- 3d scanning Scholar's Rocks
- 3d printing some rocks
- 3d design / generative art 

# Reading list

- Emerson-Dell et al [Cultivated Stones: Chinese Scholars' Rocks from the Kemin Hu Collection (2023)](https://amzn.to/3SaNfUR) --- probably a good place to start and most easily aquired

# Fordham stuff

- Interdisciplinary ICC course (Visual Art + [Art History](https://www.fordham.edu/undergraduate-admission/majors-and-minors/art-history/) + Chemistry/Computer Stuff + [Chinese studies](https://www.fordham.edu/undergraduate-admission/majors-and-minors/chinese-studies/))
    - People:  [Asato Ikeda](https://www.fordham.edu/academics/departments/art-history/faculty-and-staff/asato-ikeda/) (asian art specialization)
- There's a [Sculptural Methods](https://bulletin.fordham.edu/undergraduate/theatre-visual-arts/?_ga=2.57500202.1604001539.1703952184-1069655249.1702771203#coursestext-otp1) course on the books, but none of the visual arts faculty are sculptors, per their bios
