*Ethan Saunders '26 asks: "We learned about carbon-carbon single, double, and triple bonds...but do carbon-carbon quadruple bonds exist?"* This is a vexing question.

Although quadruple bonding (and beyond...(perhaps even up to sextuple bonding in Cr2, W2, and U2)[https://doi.org/10.1126/science.1116789]) has been observed for metal-metal bonds, triple bonding is typically considered to be the limit for main-group bonding.  However, Sason Shaik and coworkers argued (on the basis of theoretical calculations that) C2 (and its isoelectronic molecules CN+, BN, CB-) in a (2012 *Nature Chemistry* paper)[https://doi.org/10.1038/nchem.1263] that these compounds all have quadruple bonding.  In a 2016 *Chem: Eur. J* paper they claim that this also helps rationalize the structure and reactivity of C2. 

However, Oliveira de Sousa and Nascimento argue on the basis of energy partitioning calculations that the speculated "fourth" bond is destabilizing (*J. Chem. Theory. Comput. 2016*)[https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jctc.6b00055].  Highly accurate quantum Monte Carlo calculations by Genovese and Sorella suggest a partial agreement with the quadruple bond picture, with the main bonding effect resultin from spin fluctuations. (*J. Chem. Phys. 2020)[https://doi.org/10.1063/5.0023067]

Experiment?

But Rzepa has argued that this would imply a highly endoenergic reaction (based on DFT and CCSD(T)), which does not seem to be well explained . (*Nature Commun 2021*)[https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-021-21433-8]
