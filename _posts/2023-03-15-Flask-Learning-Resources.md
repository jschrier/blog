I may have to bite the bullet and develop a CRUD application. Flask doesn't seem so bad.  Some reasonable resources like:
- [Flask official documentation](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.2.x/)
- Miguel Grinberg's [Megatutorial website](https://blog.miguelgrinberg.com/post/flask-mega-tutorial-update-flask-2-0-and-more) also available as a [printed book](https://amzn.to/3YWKNRD).  He wrote a 2018 O'Reilly book, but his self-published Megatutorial book is updated more frequently, so it seems like it will be better
