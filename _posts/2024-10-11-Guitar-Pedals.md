Going to the [BK Synth and Pedal Expo](https://delicious-audio.com/brooklyn-synth-pedal-expo/) with [Tardio](https://amzn.to/3PNyQ02) last weekend, reminded me about how neat they are.  **A few resources for DIY guitar pedal building...**

# Preliminary thoughts

In a way, there are only about 6 different types of guitar pedals.  Yet, there is tremendous variety in the offerings, most differentiated by microdifferences, user interface, and branding/packaging.  Make of that what you will.

# Circuits 

- Alan Lanterman's [Guitar Amplification and Effects](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLOunECWxELQS7JV_KeeTJJpgGjOftoaAH&si=IN01nOACMy-fcZIm) course ([previously mentioned among his other music-EECS courses]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2024-06-22-Electrical-Engineering-for-Music %})).

- [Electrosmash](https://www.electrosmash.com) has some nice analysis of classic pedals

# DSP

As much as I want to love analog, we live in the digital age.  [Open-source DSP pedal kit](https://clevelandmusicco.com/hothouse-diy-digital-signal-processing-platform-kit/) based on the [daisy seed](https://electro-smith.com/products/daisy-seed)
