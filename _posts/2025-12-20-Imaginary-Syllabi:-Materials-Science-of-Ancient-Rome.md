[Fordham offers summer courses in Rome each June](https://www.fordham.edu/study-abroad/programs/summer-programs/fordham-in-rome/)...**what about a course on the Materials Science in Ancient Rome?...**

# Reading List

- [Sparavigna (2011) has written a brief introduction to "Materials Science in Ancient Rome"](https://arxiv.org/abs/1107.3831) focusing on De Architectura" by Vitruvius and the "Naturalis Historia" by Pliny the Elder
   - Pliny (trans Bostock), [The Natural History](https://amzn.to/4qkwyV5) -- may be possible to pick excerpts instead
   - Vitruvius, [de Architectura](https://amzn.to/3L1Pysq)
- Casson, [Everyday Life in Ancient Rome](https://amzn.to/4s29vjn) -- have students think about materials in their own everyday life and compare to everyday life in the ancient world. 
- Hall, [Materials: A Very Short Introduction](https://amzn.to/48PcUuy) -- very light science introduction
- Gordon, [Structures: Or Why Things Don't Fall Down](https://amzn.to/3YBcsdd) -- hghly readable, connects materials properties to mechanical properties


Other reading materials:
- Healy, [Mining and Metallurgy in the greek and roman world](https://search.worldcat.org/title/463199001)
- [Sparavigna has also written on](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cites=10759306643485855589&as_sdt=5,33&sciodt=0,33&hl=en) [ancient concrete](https://arxiv.org/abs/1110.5230) and [depletion gilding](https://arxiv.org/abs/1601.00845) 

# Organizing Themes

Materials and their role in human flourishing
Ceramics (break this up into cement & glass) - Metals - (bio)Polymers
Structure - Property - Processing

## Cement

- Cement, Concrete & geopolymers in building construction
   - **Visit:** Archeological sites (esp. [Pantheon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pantheon,_Rome), [Baths of Caracalla](https://www.rome.net/baths-caracalla), [Ostia Antica](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ostia_Antica) )

Other ideas:
- Pottery and amphoras, global trade

##  Glass

- Glass (as mosaic and small glass blown works)
  - **Visit:**  [Tabula Rasa](https://www.tabvlarasa.com) for discussion and demonstration of marble and mosaic glass working 
  - **Visit:** [Vatican mosaic studio](https://www.basilicasanpietro.va/en/san-pietro/the-mosaic-studio). 
- **Activity:** Micromosaic workshop? Glassblowing workshop?  

## Metals

- **Background material:**
   - [Metallurgy and metal processing in the ancient world](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_metallurgy)
  - [Metalsmiths guide to Rome](https://www.ganoksin.com/article/metalsmiths-guide-rome/) --- some nice ideas include: Museo Nazionale di Villa Giulia and Biblioteca dell'Istituto Nazionale di Archeologia e Storia dell Arte
- **Visit:** museum collections focused on metallurgy
    - [Museo Nazionale Romano](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Museo_Nazionale_Romano) has some roman bronzes and coins, and also has a Jesuit collection as it houses [Athanasius Kircher's collection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kircherian_Museum)
    - [Museo di Chimica Primo Levi](https://museochimica.web.uniroma1.it/en/about-us) --- not ancient focused, but perhaps valuable
- **Activity:** [Lost-wax microcasting class at Accademia delle Arti Orafe](https://www.scuoladioreficeria.it/en/our-courses/)

- Other ideas:
    - Sewer pipes! 

## Polymers

- Bartolucci, et al. [Phase diagram of Cacio e pepe (2025)](https://pubs.aip.org/aip/pof/article/37/4/044122/3345324/Phase-behavior-of-Cacio-e-Pepe-sauce) -- experimental physics study, soft-matter, self assembly, phase diagrams
- Pasta making activity (biopolymers)

Other ideas:
- Physical chemistry of gelato


# Assessments

- Daily blog posts / reflections - materials that you used today that weren't present in Roman times
- Final paper/project ideas
    - Time traveller:  How would you produce some modern material with the technology available in ancient rome?
    - Academic research:  Dive into one of the topics (perhaps as a focus on conservation science?)



# Community notes

- [Elizabeth Thrall](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=i83RsVAAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao) suggests other possible topics:  (i) Lead pipes and plumbing...with a connection to [contemporary environmental justice issues in Flint, Michigan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flint_water_crisis); (ii) phase separations using excellent olive oil and aged balsamic (with paired degustation); (iii) cultural heritage preservation and spectroscopy/analytical chemistry methods
