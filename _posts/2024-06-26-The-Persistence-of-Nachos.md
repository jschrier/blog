**Backstory:** Did you know that Dali [wrote a cookbook](https://rebeccambender.com/2016/12/16/dali-cookbook/)? ([more](https://www.themarginalian.org/index.php/2014/04/29/salvador-dali-les-diners-de-galacookbook/)) You can even [buy a reprint copy](https://amzn.to/3zeQLGq). But it lacks a recipe for nachos inspired by one of his famous works. Also: Seeing a poster in NYC about cutting stars out of cheese for a holiday celebration and brainstorming other silly cookie cutters that could be made and used...

## Implementation

- Watch-shaped cookie cutters exist on the [market ready-made](https://www.jbcookiecutters.com/product/pocket-watch-100-cookie-cutter-set/) or [3d-print your own](https://cults3d.com/en/3d-model/home/harry-potter-pocket-watch-cutter-and-embosser). In the five minutes I looked, I could not find a free design, but as we only need the outline, so it would be easy to design your own.

- Get a fake mustache

- Make nachos

(*"Salvador Dali', the prominent Spanish surrealist painter, had a distinctive and memorable appearance. He is most famously recognized for his flamboyant mustache, which he often styled in an exaggerated, upward-curled fashion. Dali''s mustache was so iconic that it became an integral part of his identity and public persona.In addition to his mustache, Dali' had sharp, expressive eyes that often conveyed a sense of intense curiosity or whimsy. His gaze was penetrating and sometimes seemed almost hypnotic, adding to his enigmatic charisma.Dali''s hairstyles varied over the years, but he often kept his hair relatively short and neat, albeit sometimes with a slight wave or a touch of eccentricity in its styling.His wardrobe was another reflection of his eclectic and theatrical personality. Dali' frequently dressed in elegant, flamboyant fashion, favoring tailored suits with unique and sometimes outlandish details. He wasn't afraid to incorporate bold patterns, luxurious fabrics, or unusual accessories into his attire, further enhancing his eccentric artist image.Overall, Salvador Dali''s physical appearance was a carefully crafted extension of his surrealist art, characterized by an air of extravagance, whimsy, and unmistakable individuality."*)

(*"\"The Persistence of Memory\" is a painting renowned for its surreal and dream-like quality. The composition is dominated by a barren, almost desolate landscape featuring a rocky coastline that extends into the distance beneath a softly illuminated sky. In the foreground, there are several melting, almost liquefied clocks draped over various objects: a dead tree branch, a rectangular platform or ledge, and a peculiar amorphous form that appears partially organic and partially abstract.The texture of the melting clocks is rendered with a hyper-realistic precision, making their fluid, distorted forms appear particularly jarring against the stark, detailed background. One of the clocks sports a swarm of ants, adding an element of decay and unease.On the left side of the painting, a leafless tree grows out of a solid rectangular block. The tree and block both create a stark contrast with the softness and fluidity of the melting clocks. The way light is used in the painting enhances the eerie and otherworldly atmosphere, casting sharp shadows and highlighting certain areas with a soft, almost unnatural glow.The color palette consists mainly of muted, earthy tones punctuated by the bright, almost metallic sheen of the clocks. This use of color further emphasizes the dream-like, hypnotic quality of the scene, enhancing the viewer's sense of disorientation and surrealism."*)

(*"The image depicts a flat piece of cheese shaped like a melting clock atop a pile of nacho chips. The cheese drapes languidly over the chips, with its fluid, timepiece form giving the appearance that it\[CloseCurlyQuote]s slowly melting into the crunchy bed beneath. The golden, gooey cheese resembles the famous surreal clocks of Salvador Dali', its edges curling and sagging, almost as if time itself is dissolving into the sea of tortilla chips."*)
