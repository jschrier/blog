Project ideas from my recent trip to Berlin/Heidelberg...

# Imaginary Video Games (in 8-bit 80s style)

- Welcome to [Neverland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neverland_Ranch) (living with Michael Jackson simulator)
- Welcome to [Neukölln](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neukölln_(locality)) (hipster simulator, occasional Palestiner protest, falafel)
- Where in the World is [Jeffrey Epstein](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeffrey_Epstein)? (in the style of [Carmen Sandiego](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carmen_Sandiego_(character))) 
- Mo[Napoli](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naples):  Garbage strikes and Pizza (but otherwise like a Monopoly game)

# Music (When in Berlin...Techno is king...)

- What is the theory of techno music making? (Beginner's guide, basic ideas, rhythm/timbre variations). There are [some videos](https://youtu.be/JcjT7zgs6cs?si=lNgG04QGhALIuz64) about this...
- Baby's First Techno Kit (simplified beat box)
- Techno Tarot Deck:  cards with QR codes that generate particular kick/high-hat choices, scales for progressions (as read into an app)
- 1920s style jazz
- get back into saxaphone
- finally [build a drum machine...]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2023-04-20-DIY-drum-machine-ideas %})
- [Imaginary Syllabi:  Major in Techno]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2024-05-25-Imaginary-Syllabi:-Major-in-Techno %})
- [Michael Sterns-style space music](https://michaelstearns.bandcamp.com/album/planetary-unfolding-2022-remaster), but as a Gamebody cartridge

# Art

- [Victor Vasarely]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2024-04-24-Victor-Vasarely %}) designs in marble and gold
- Imaginary Cinema:  Mad Max, but with Kangaroos
- Convert [Caspar David Friedrich landscapes](https://www.smb.museum/en/exhibitions/detail/caspar-david-friedrich/) into [Rothko-style color-field](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Rothko) paintings by taking the average color on each line
- Use a style-transfer imagine transfer model to convert pornography into Picasso-style cubistic nudes ("art!")
- Stable diffusion on Gerhard Richter [schmear paintings](https://www.artnews.com/art-in-america/features/gerhard-richter-painting-58768/)...whats's the underlying pattern or structure
- Augmented reality baroque overlay (especially fun if you make this site-specific for a place like the [Bauhaus museum](https://bauhaus-dessau.de))
- Making Baroque era architectural drawings into photorealistic CAD

# Fashion

- Backstage pass- style micromosaic/leather jewerly
- Leather "festival" bracelets: Could have a special RFID clasp that breaks when unlocked.
- Hawaiian shirts in the style of [Karl Schmidt-Rottluff](https://www.bruecke-museum.de/en/sammlung/kuenstler/792/karl-schmidt-rottluff)
    - (**UPDATE 01/2025**): [Reddit thread on Hawaiian shirt print-on-demand services](https://www.reddit.com/r/printondemand/comments/1cvqy1p/hawaiianstyle_shirts_on_demand/) ... and [print-on-demand in general](https://www.reddit.com/r/printondemand/comments/1b383kx/my_reviews_of_yoycol_printify_huge_pod_this_new/); reviews of [yoycol](https://www.yoycol.com/design/%7B%22type%22%3A%22new%22%2C%22spuCode%22%3A%223WCSTY05%22%7D) praise decent construction and good design interface, but shipping can be slow. Seems like the least bad option. [printify](https://printify.com/app/products/924/generic-brand/mens-hawaiian-shirt-aop) also seems decent but 3x cost. 


# Home projects

- Clean up the router/music nook to make more room for synthesizers
- Novels:  Hollebeq's *Submission*, African Sci Fi  (*Apocalypse Now Now*, *Zoo City*)
