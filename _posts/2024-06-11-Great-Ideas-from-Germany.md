Project ideas from my recent trip to Berlin/Heidelberg...

# Imaginary Video Games (in 8-bit 80s style)

- Welcome to [Neverland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neverland_Ranch) (living with Michael Jackson simulator)
- Welcome to [Neukölln](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neukölln_(locality)) (hipster simulator, occasional Palestiner protest, falafel)
- Where in the World is [Jeffrey Epstein](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeffrey_Epstein)? (in the style of [Carmen Sandiego](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carmen_Sandiego_(character))) 
- Mo[Napoli](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naples):  Garbage strikes and Pizza (but otherwise like a Monopoly game)

# Music (When in Berlin...Techno is king...)

- What is the theory of techno music making? (Beginner's guide, basic ideas, rhythm/timbre variations). There are [some videos](https://youtu.be/JcjT7zgs6cs?si=lNgG04QGhALIuz64) about this...
- Baby's First Techno Kit (simplified beat box)
- Techno Tarot Deck:  cards with QR codes that generate particular kick/high-hat choices, scales for progressions (as read into an app)
- 1920s style jazz
- get back into saxaphone
- finally [build a drum machine...]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2023-04-20-DIY-drum-machine-ideas %})
- [Imaginary Syllabi:  Major in Techno]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2024-05-25-Imaginary-Syllabi:-Major-in-Techno %})
- [Michael Sterns-style space music](https://michaelstearns.bandcamp.com/album/planetary-unfolding-2022-remaster), but as a Gamebody cartridge

# Art

- Use a style-transfer imagine transfer model to convert pornography into Picasso-style cubistic nudes ("art!")
- Stable diffusion on Gerhard Richter schmear paitings...whats's the underlying pattern or structure
- Augmented reality baroque overlay (especially fun if you make this site-specific for a place like the Bauahaus museum)
- Making Baroque era arhcitectural drawings into photorealistic CAD

# Fashion
