A recent [article on Frederick Copleston, SJ](https://www.americamagazine.org/arts-culture/2025/10/14/the-patron-saint-of-undergraduate-philosophers-frederick-copleston/) tickled my neurons about admiration for this historian of philosophy...

I first came across Copleston during my studies of Schopenhauer, in a rather indirect way.  Reading the [obituary of philosophy popularizer Bryan Magee](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/28/business/bryan-magee-dead.html) in the newspaper lead me to read [Magee's memoir](https://amzn.to/4neRBXd), in which he describes [Copleston appearing on his BBC program and discussing Schopenhauer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oef8CBoKRds) with the familiarity and love that one would have for a somewhat disreputable schoolmate. (Both had written books on Schopenhauer, namely [Magee's *Philosophy of Schopenauer*](https://amzn.to/4nR8w2Z) and [Copleston's *Schopenauer: Philosopher of Pessmism*](https://amzn.to/4o4WGm3)), which relates to [my own interest in old Schoppy]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2023-03-04-Imaginary-Books:-Schopenhauer-f√ºr-Kinder %})

I'm inclined to purchase [his 11-volume History of Philosophy](https://amzn.to/3KMqgOC) for my archives.

[Copleston's Memoirs](https://books.google.com/books/about/Memoirs_of_a_Philosopher.html?id=WLJiEQAAQBAJ) are an easy read, with a few amusing anecdotes and reflections on a changing world, but as one would expect for a prolific scholar, nothing too wild occurs.
