Prof. Aaron Lanternman (GATech) has some wonderful youtube videos for his electrical engineering courses on [Guitar Amplification and Effects](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLOunECWxELQS7JV_KeeTJJpgGjOftoaAH&si=IN01nOACMy-fcZIm) and [Analog Circuits for Music Synthesis](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLOunECWxELQS5bMdWo9VhmZtsCjhjYNcV&si=HSB849ZHMTS6vLNW)...  

Both of these have a intro to EECS circuits course.  Lanternman explicitly mentions [Prof. Bonny Ferri's coursera courses as serving thsi role](https://www.coursera.org/instructor/bferri).  But he also flips through [Meresau and Jackson's, Circuit Analysis](https://amzn.to/4cppr6Y) textbook in a video, so I'll take that as an implicit recommendation.

[On his blog, Lanterman recommends](https://edupocalypsenow.wordpress.com/2014/10/12/observations-about-courseras-fundamentals-of-ee-by-don-johnson/) [Don Johnson's Fundamentals of Electrical Engineering](https://www.ece.rice.edu/~dhj/courses/elec241/) --- going so far as to call it the 'SICP of Electrical Engineering'

His [Signals and Systems](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLOunECWxELQRYwsuj4BL4Hu1nvj9dxRQ6&si=6hbahe7t97ozgnGS) course also looks fascinating (continouous time systems)....but as he describes in the intro course assumes a pre-requisiting in a discrete time analysis course (ECE2026).  This is also a pre-req for the music class (although he says we won't get into too many details)

His [ECE Design Fundamentals](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLOunECWxELQTn3DQYYB4qaEC9KRK5mHNK&si=RBLwMLgibIg_U7_1) has a lot of important practical guidance for (analog) circuit design, and is mentioned as being a co-playlist for the Analog Circuits for Music synth course
