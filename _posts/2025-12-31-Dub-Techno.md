An appreciation of [dub techno](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dub_techno), and how to make it...

# What do I like about it?

- It appeals to my interests in ambient space music and minimal techo, but a bit more peppy
- It tends to avoid annoying EDM tropes like ramps, supersaws, drops
- It leaves room open for experimentation, generative strategies, and exploring new sonic architectures
- OTOH, it's hard to really define a "composition" and much of it tends to sound similar

# History

- [Video: The Origin and History of Dub Techo (10:54)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YWbhxqCRd5o) 
- [Basic Channel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_Channel) is effectively the originator

# How to make it (in Ableton)

One of the challenges in these videos: They tend to use effects/instruments that are only present in the Ableton Suite, not the intro version. I've tried to figure out substitutions when possible.

- [Video: Understanding Dub Techno ─ A Musicologist's Approach (39:15)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XMWPQmSBOw) ---  as much a lecture on the aesthetic motifs (spontaneous repetition from delays, atmospheric modulation using LFOs, embracing noise sources) as it is a "how-to" tutorial.  (sub wavetable --> drift or [vital](http://vital.audio), echo --> dub echo, DS Kick --> any old kick, resonators --> ??? )
- [Video: Ableton Live Tutorial - Minimal Dub Techno](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IB2Q7EUK1qI) --- I love this guys irreverant take. He makes an entire track just by processing a kick through various return tracks. It's interesting how he does this all with effects, without explicitly using any LFOs. (DS Kick --> some kick, [spectral resonator](https://www.ableton.com/en/blog/spectral-sound-a-look-at-live-11s-new-spectral-devices/) --> ???, vocoder --> ???, resonators --> ???, dynamic tube --> ??? (skipable), spectral time --> ???, OTT --> [xfer records OTT](https://xferrecords.com/freeware)  )
- [Video: How to make Dub Techno chords, drums, and bass (20:39)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t2_4Ib-TgF0) --- pretty simple setup with minimal effects: kick + shaker + clave (samples) + synth chords (massive --> [vital](http://vital.audio) or drift). Unlike the other ones, he's essentially composing the baseline, with some basic baseline, no complicated patterns.
- [Article: Pheek’s Guide To Making Dub Techno](https://audioservices.studio/production/pheeks-dub-techno-making-guide) --- good because it describes particular effects and substitutions and gives some guidance on how they feel sonically.
