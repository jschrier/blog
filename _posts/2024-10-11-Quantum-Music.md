I stumbled upon a strange rabbit hole: quantum music, wherein one uses a (simulated) quantum computer to sequence your tones. [Music of](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musica_universalis) the [Bloch spheres](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloch_sphere), indeed.  The [Goethe Institut sponsored a festival on this in 2023](https://physicsworld.com/a/can-we-use-quantum-computers-to-make-music/) and there is a [2022 collected volume on the topic](https://amzn.to/4eCDSWL),  and the [CTM 2024 conference had a few talks on the topic](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLyPfuzP_o3SxBVaRrrAqLoh4UC2Ay87lF) but I haven't heard anything too compelling yet.
