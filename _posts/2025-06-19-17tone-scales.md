Got into a rabbit hole about [George Secor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Secor)'s paper [The 17-tone Puzzle â€” And the
Neo-medieval Key That Unlocks It](https://anaphoria.com/Secor17puzzle.pdf) inspired by a [youtube video on the topic](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=22loDjBcRMc)...

Nice [recording of Secor playing the Scalatron (1974)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNFK6PxgmRk). Here's [another, with photos of his scalatron](https://emeapp.org/2021/03/02/george-secor-music-mathematics-and-the-miracle-temperament/)

The [Ableton Live documentation on tuning systems](https://tuning.ableton.com) is quite extensive. Although this particular tuning is not available in default in Ableton Live 12, it is straightforward to [define your own tuning systems for Ableton by creating a short Scala file](https://tuning.ableton.com/make-your-own-tuning/) ... a scala file defining Secor's well-temperated 17-tone scale [can be downloaded](https://en.xen.wiki/w/Secor_wt17) but doesn't appear to follow Secor's recommendation to set the pitch to C = 264 Hz.  [Here's an alternative which follows this correctly](/blog/images/2025/6/19/secor-17wt.ascl)

Page dedicated to [17EDO](https://en.xen.wiki/w/17edo) with links to music pieces, e.g., [EDM-type pieces](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEWYpAxeQ9Q) 

I have not yet gone down the rabbit hole of adoption of 17-tone scales in [persian classical music](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjAEDnm6XD4)
