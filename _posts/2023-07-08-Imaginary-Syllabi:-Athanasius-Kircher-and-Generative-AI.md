*Premise:*  Consider a general intelligence capable of producing text and images on demand about topics as diverse as chemistry, mathematics, music making, ancient and foreign languages, biblical hermaneutics, the invention of gadgets and scientific instruments, and descriptions of far-away lands.[^1] The output is voluminous, verbose, and presents arguments and sources about things that are true...and also about topics that are mythical or completely fabricated. Are we talking about [ChatGPT](https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2023/02/what-is-chatgpt-doing-and-why-does-it-work/) or the 17th century Jesuit polymath [Athansius Kircher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Athanasius_Kircher)? **How might a study of Kircher inform our approach to generative AI? A syllabus...**   

# Backstory and Motivations

Yesterday, I saw the documentary [Umberto Eco: A Library o the World](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/06/29/movies/umberto-eco-a-library-of-the-world-review.html). Eco was a huge fan of Kircher: [Eco boasted that that he had collected all but one of Kircher's books](https://lithub.com/umberto-ecos-favorite-books-give-new-meaning-to-the-phrase-deep-cut/) and Kircher has a walk-on roles in some of Eco's novels (as well as in scholarly work).  Eco described Kircher as "the most contemporary among our ancestors, and the most outdated among our contemporaries" and in the film has an admiration for the way in which fact and fiction are blurred in Kircher's writings.  

Which made me think---isn't this a lot like our concerns about the [stochastic parrots](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3442188.3445922) of generative AI? Like Kircher, generative AI models are trained on a vast corpus of human knowledge and draw upon this to generate high-probability combinations that are surprisingly good, but equally susceptible to hallucinations.  How might an engagement with Kircher and his ways of knowing be insightful for students as they try to live in a world with generative AI?

Even more relevant, Kircher's [Organum Mathematicum](https://gate.unigre.it/mediawiki/index.php/Athanasius_Kircherâ€™s_Organum_mathematicum._On_the_Evolutionary_Improbability_of_an_Information_Processing_Innovation) was a type of proto-computer, with a human-machine interface for creativity.  A great starting point.


# Course topics

- Athanasius Kircher and the Society of Jesus in the 17th Century
- Learn some Latin reading skills (to engage with Kircher's manuscripts)
- Methods of Generative AI: Do some practical stuff with LLMs and Diffusion models
- Do a final project---produce and critique a Kircherian work with Generative AI

# Readings: Books about Kircher

There are a few biographical-ish works on Kircher

* Glassie, [A Man of Misconceptions: The Life of an Eccentric in an Age of Change](https://amzn.to/44j2dvq) (2013) -- popular book, had positive reviews in Sci Am, NYT, New Yorker
* Peters, [The Man Who Knew Everything: The Strange Life of Athanasius Kircher](https://amzn.to/3XEfzQx) (2017) -- my sense is that this is too popular/juvenile for our purposes, based on a skim 
* Findlen (ed), [Athanasius Kircher: The Last Man Who Knew Everything](https://amzn.to/3D2iwAC) (2004) -- edited volume of essays on Kircher. Probably useful to have on rseserve for reference 

# Readings: Books by Kircher

- [Monumenta Kircheri](https://gate.unigre.it/mediawiki/index.php/Monumenta_Kircheri)

# Readings: Latin

Given that Kircher's works are all in Latin, and English translations are lacking, it is probably desirable that students build up some very basic Latin reading skills.  Also [Claude Pavur, SJ](https://amzn.to/3pD6avM) would approve of us continuing to make Latin part of the curriculum, in lines with the *Ratio Studiorum*

Probably just use Orberg's [Lingua Latina](https://amzn.to/44hu1jI) for this purpose. 

# Readings: Generative AI methods

I'm a contrarian, and the students taking this course aren't necessarily technical, so I would be inclined to use our favorite Mathematica for this purpose.

- Start with Etienne Bernard's [Introduction to Machine Learning](https://www.wolfram-media.com/products/introduction-to-machine-learning/)
- Then move into more [generative things with LLMs](https://www.wolfram.com/wolfram-u/courses/language-integrations/new-llm-functionality-in-wolfram-language/), etc. 


# Fordham stuff

 - [Eric Bianchi](https://www.fordham.edu/academics/departments/music/faculty-and-staff/eric-bianchi/) in the music department has done work on intellectual and scientific underpinnings of Kircher's musical writing and [supervised a student hypertext project about Kircher's book on Noah's ark](https://honorsbookculture.ace.fordham.edu/kirchers-encyclopedic-visions)
- The Fordham library has at least one Kircher manuscript in its holdings.
 - Run this as an [Interdisciplinary Capstone](https://bulletin.fordham.edu/undergraduate/fordham-college-core-curriculum/capstone-courses/) with history plus philosophy plus computer science

# Parerga and Paralipomena

- The [cat organ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cat_organ) would be an excellent addition to a [cat cafe](({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2023-06-27-Great-ideas-from-Korea %}))
- Riff on the idea of word embeddings and Kircher's [Polygraphia Nova](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polygraphia_Nova).  c.f. Eco's [The Search for the Perfect Langauge](https://amzn.to/43f3UIX)
