I periodically remember how much I enjoy analog computing as an idea. **Time to start a post...**

- [Anabrid's THAT...450 EUR](https://shop.anabrid.com) - as a way to play around
    - A nice [play through blog post](https://metebalci.com/blog/the-analog-thing/) of using the THAT
    - [Bernd Ulmann's textbook](https://amzn.to/4asGyDo) (he has another book too which is more on the history of analog computing)

- (22 sept 2025) When you tire of patch cables, [Anabrid's LUCIDAC](https://anabrid.com/lucidac) is a programmable analog computer (for about $9k)
