While skimming a back issue of *Mathematics Magazine*, I came across Jordan Schettler's article [Wendy Carlos’s Xenharmonic Keyboard](https://www.jstor.org/stable/48665908) which describes a continued fraction derivation of an [idea by Wendy Carlo](https://www.wendycarlos.com/resources/pitch.html)---whereas "traditional" tuning ideas are based on preserving the octave (2:1 frequency) ratio, we might alternatively just try to find equal tempered scales that give a good approximation to the perfect fifth (3:2) and major third (5:4) and forget about this giving an octave...  

Here's a [short 6-minute video describing and sonifying Carlo's alpha, beta, and gamma scales ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuT6Y53LYH4)...

Benson's [Music: A Mathematical Offering](https://homepages.abdn.ac.uk/d.j.benson/pages/html/music.pdf) Section 6.6 gives a lucid description of Carlo's approach. You can listen to some example notes on the [alpha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpha_scale), [beta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beta_scale), and [gamma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamma_scale) scale wikipedia pages.

Carlos used the alpha and beta scales on an album [Beauty in the Beast](https://www.wendycarlos.com/+bitb.html).  These scales have some interesting properties---for example, alpha splits the minor third exactly into halves (and quarters), and beta splits the perfect fourth into halves.

Closely related is the [Bohlen-Pierce scale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bohlen–Pierce_scale) starts from the foundational choice of the tritave (3:1)---aka the perfect twelth or an octave higher than a perfect fifth (3:2)---and divides this into 13 parts.  This is dicsused in [Section 6.7 in Benson]((https://homepages.abdn.ac.uk/d.j.benson/pages/html/music.pdf) ).  Apparently this idea is called [EDONOI](https://en.xen.wiki/w/Edonoi)---"equal divisions of non-octave intervals."

More fundamentally, why do we priviledge the octave in the first place?  Keuler writes about the [octave identity paradox](https://www.jstor.org/stable/902559), noting that the octave identity is a historical byproduct, and that many musically untrained listeners will mistake fourths and fifths for octaves.
