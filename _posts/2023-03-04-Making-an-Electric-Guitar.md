*Joseph Tardio asks:  I want to make a custom electric guitar...*  **I'm always in for a Fusion360 and CNC project...**

## Body

- Purchased a F360 file from Etsy for a Telecaster design
- Moved the cavities and did some redesign
- Purchased a 1.75" block of Ash from [Dyke's](https://www.dykeslumber.com)
- Interior pockets  with tight radii using a  1/4"x1"CL downcut bit, marked the position for the string holes and neck mounting holes with a tapered ball mill bit,  cut the deeper pocket and contour using a [3/8" x 2" CL downcut](https://www.toolstoday.com/v-15071-46449-k.html) 

- I really like the [contrasting look of wood and colored epoxy as shown in this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gSXfv0iJSkI), so keep that in a back pocket for future projects

## Neck

- The most important guideline is to have 25.5 inches from the bridge to the nut slot.  Everything else is negotiable.
- Started by using a downloaded file from Etsy, but ultimately had to design our own
- Just buy a fretboard and glue it on.
- Truss rods are complicated, so for the prototype we're gonna forget about it
- Great video on designing the neck especially [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shxir1Z4Bw8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shxir1Z4Bw8)
- Purchased a 3/4" thick maple board for the neck from [Dyke's](https://www.dykeslumber.com)  


## Double Machining the Neck

- Just do it. Decent video on the process in F360: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ce6mYKMAoX8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ce6mYKMAoX8)



## Aside: 3d printing

- [Prusacaster](https://blog.prusa3d.com/the-prusacaster-how-to-design-and-3d-print-an-electric-guitar_71962/) - cool idea, just bought the neck and 3d printed the body in sections.  It's cool, just a different project
