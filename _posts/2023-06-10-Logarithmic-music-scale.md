Screw [Pythagoras](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pythagorean_tuning)![] Interesting [modwiggler thread on non-pythagorean tunings](https://www.modwiggler.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=269599).  One that leaps out is Robert Schneider's [logarithmic tuning](https://arxiv.org/abs/1312.5020) has some interesting sounding beat frequencies; he made an [album using the logarithmic tuning](https://cloudrecordings.bandcamp.com/album/songs-for-other-worlds-2) which has some interesting sounds.  There are also interesting properties in "macrotonal" scales, such as the [7EDO](https://en.xen.wiki/w/7edo) used in some African and early Chinese musics and [9EDO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pelog) scales used in Indonesian music.
