Friedrich Franz Nord (1889-1973) was a prolific biochemistry professor at [Fordham University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fordham_University) from 1938 until his retirement in 1960 (after which he continued to be active in research as an emeritus professor). According to his [NY Times obituary](https://www.nytimes.com/1973/07/19/archives/friedrich-nord-biochemist-dies-fordham-professor-emeritus-first.html), he did pioneering work on cryobiology and the chemistry of lignin formation and degradation.  A native of Germany, he had appointments at the Max Planck Institute for Biochemistry and (following service in WWI) the Physiological Institute of the University of Berlin, before moving to the United States. At his retirement, he had published 360 scientific papers, held several patents, and founded 3 scientific journals.[2](https://www.nytimes.com/1960/05/31/archives/fordham-professor-will-retire.html). [Google scholar](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=ff+nord&hl=en&as_sdt=0%2C33&as_ylo=1900&as_yhi=1974) gives an incomplete survey of the diversity of his work, which spanned catalysis, organic chemistry, biochemistry, and polymer chemistry.  There is a bronze bust of Prof. Nord in the Chemistry department. Curiously there is [no wikipedia entry for him](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Fordham_University_faculty).
