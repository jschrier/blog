*Inspired by a discussion with Zachary Jones '25:* An interdisciplinary course on the philosophy and history of logistics and war (as distinct from [economic optimization and war]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2023-01-22-Imaginary-Syllabi:-War-and-Peace-and-Optimization %}) proposed earlier).Students will focus on the philosophy/criticism of [Paul Virilio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Virilio), historical examples of logistics, and elementary aspects of mathematical modeling of logistics, with a special focus on linear programming and Monte Carlo simulations (performing relevant calculations in Mathematica). **Reading lists to include...**

## Required texts

- Works by philosopher/critic [Paul Virilio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Virilio) on the architecture of war, the configuration of cities for war logistics, etc. (t.b.d)
- van Crevald, [Supplying War: Logistics from Wallenstein to Patton](https://amzn.to/3ZCXsdo) --- historical study on logistics in military history
- Chopra, [Supply Chain Management: Strategy, Planning, and Operation](https://amzn.to/3mvNJak) --- intro textbook on supply chain management


## Supplementary readings

-  H. Paul Williams, [Mathematical Programming](https://amzn.to/3kAek5m) ---  A solid introduction to optimization ("programming") topics and their applications for newcomers
- Shapiro, [Modeling the Suppply Chain](https://amzn.to/41LY5mD) --- source of problems for linear and integer programming applications in models
- Liu, [Supply Chain Analytics](https://amzn.to/3JbgjH9) --- source of problems for data-analytics/ML type exercises

## Fordham stuff

 - Run this as an [Interdisciplinary Capstone](https://bulletin.fordham.edu/undergraduate/fordham-college-core-curriculum/capstone-courses/) (Philosophy + History + [Military Science](https://bulletin.fordham.edu/undergraduate/special-academic-programs/rotc/army-rotc-military-science/#coursestext) + [Gabelli](https://www.fordham.edu/gabelli-school-of-business/academic-programs-and-admissions/undergraduate-programs/) + Math).
