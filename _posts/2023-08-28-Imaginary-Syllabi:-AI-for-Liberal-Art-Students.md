**A collection of reading lists for introducing AI concepts and practice to a general population of starting undergraduates...**

(with the idea of building up materials that could be used in a variety of courses; perhaps an EP1-style introductory course at Fordham; resources are generally Mathematica-heavy)

# Motivations

- ["Liberally-educated students need to be more than consumers of AI" (2023)](https://tedunderwood.com/2023/09/10/liberally-educated-students-need-to-be-more-than-consumers-of-ai/)--- students should actively engage with AI as creators and critics (and on a technical level), rather than just passive consumers, in order to navigate a future increasingly dominated by AI. The best way to do this is to have some fundamental mathematical/statistical/computational [chops](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/chops), so they can be critical and adaptable.

# Computational Thinking

- Wolfram, [An Elementary Introduction to the Wolfram Language](https://www.wolfram.com/language/elementary-introduction/2nd-ed/index.html)
- Christian & Griffiths, [Algorithms to Live By: The Computer Science of Human Decision](https://amzn.to/3OM4mZS) -- how to apply ideas of computer algorithms to solve everyday life problems

# Machine Learning

# AI

- Pre-reading: Bottou & Schölkopf, [Borges and AI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.01425)

- Intellectual history of mathematical representations of words and concepts (from [Raymond Llul](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ramon_Llull), [Athanasius Kircher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polygraphia_Nova), [Leibnitz](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/leibniz-mind/), etc.) --> [word/sentence embeddings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Word_embedding)
- Try some practical things regarding text, such as [basic prompt engineering]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2023-08-02-Imaginary-Syllabi:-Prompt-Engineering-And-Addressative-Magic %}), [summarization methods]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2023-08-27-Three-LLM-Summarization-Strategies %}), [retrieval augmented generation methods]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2023-08-24-Retrieval-Augmented-Generation %})

- Philosophical discussion:  How much of what we attribute to "reasoning" and "planning" in daily life is just simple pattern matching? And [how might we be fooled into think a pattern-matching LLM is "reasoning"](https://cacm.acm.org/blogs/blog-cacm/276268-can-llms-really-reason-and-plan/fulltext)? 

# Applications
