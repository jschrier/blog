**Some notes on getting started in software defined radio (SDR)...**

# Resources

- [Paul Nahin, Science of Radio](https://amzn.to/3ImLRvI) --- i really enjoy Nahin's books. This isn't about SDR, per se, but would set you up with the fundamentals.
- [Clark & Clark, "Practical SDR](https://nostarch.com/practical-sdr) --- seems like a nice book to start with
- [RTL-SDR](https://www.rtl-sdr.com/about-rtl-sdr/) is kind of the right place to start. $30, well documented and engineered. RX only.
- [HackRF Pro](https://greatscottgadgets.com/hackrf/pro/) -- $400. RX/TX. Again, well supported and documented
- [PicoRX](https://101-things.readthedocs.io/en/latest/radio_receiver.html) --- use a raspberry pi pico to build a minimalistic SDR.  Appeals to my sensibilities.

# What are you going to do?

- (added 16 Sep 2025) [50 Things to do with SDR](https://blinry.org/50-things-with-sdr/) --- nice blog post using an RTL-SDR dongle, home-made antennas, and SDR++ software to explore 50 different signals you can check out.  Written by a beginner for beginners.

# Backstory: Radio

- As a kid, I thought ham radio was cool, but didn't have enough money to play around. I may have built a crystal radio though. 
- As a college student, in the late 1990s when internet was metered, I thought packet radio was cool (free internet!), but basically read about it vicariously.
- As a graduate student,in the early 200s, I got a ham license (KG6WPP), which has since expired.  I remember taking the test in Oakland one sunday morning. Afterwards got a VHF handy talky, and would listen to the repeaters, but never had much of an interest in broadcasting. 
- As a grad student/postdoc, used to read the [ARRL magazine](https://www.arrl.org/arrl-magazines) (among others) in the Berkeley public library on saturday afternoons, after going typing on the laptop at Caffe Strada in the morning and then going to the farmer's market. 
- Generally thought the idea of VHF to satellites was cool.  I still think the idea of an "orbital hunting club" (sort of like duck hunt, but with radios and satellites) would be amusing. 
- My buddy, [Bob the Chemist](http://bobthechemist.com), got into ham radio in the past few years, reawakening interest.
