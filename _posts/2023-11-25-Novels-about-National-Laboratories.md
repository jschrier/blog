Campus novels about academic life are so common.  But what about novels that are set at national laboratories (in which, the lab is itself a type of character).  Excluded are biographies, etc. **A few good ones I have read...**

# Livermore

- Carter Scholz, [Radiance](https://amzn.to/40RZ84H) a roman a clef set in 1990s LLNL developing an imaginary missile defense system; it captures the flavor of bureacracy and career paths at the labs (in a depressing way). [Gwern.net](https://gwern.net/doc/radiance/2002-scholz-radiance) has it online.

# Los Alamos

- Thomas McMahon, [Principles of American Nuclear Chemistry](https://amzn.to/3Ghj3Av) conveyed by a late-20s-year old in psychotherapy as he recollects his boyhood as a 13-year old growing up in the shadow of the Manhattan project.  Compelling read, all characters a roman a clef (e.g., the famous Italian Ferrini, the Danish physicist Ohr, ...).  (I suppose there is a chapter at Oak Ridge early on, but LANL is really the home here.)

# Berkeley

- Clifford Stoll, [The Cuckoo's Egg](https://amzn.to/40SOkTG) -- strictly speaking this is non-fiction, but it captures the feeling of Berkeley, and is an entertaining romp of tracking down Russian hackers in the 1990s.
