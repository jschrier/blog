[Jonathan Kinlay's blog](https://jonathankinlay.com/) had some slick embedded PDFs of Mathematica notebooks.  Looking at the source code (he uses wordpress), they are just PDFs with a paginator. Apparently [you can do embed PDFs in Jekyll pages too](https://talk.jekyllrb.com/t/embed-pdf-in-github-pages/4527), so I might try that sometime. Note to self.
