According to Wikipedia, [Charles Fort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Fort) lived on [Ryer Ave in the Bronx](https://maps.app.goo.gl/snCB9B3dxVcG1PEX6) (runs parallel-ish between Grand Concourse and Webster Ave, east of [Arthur Ave](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_Avenue )) not far from the Fordham campus. (Inspired by reading a [book review](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-02226-7) of [Think to New Worlds: The Cultural History of Charles Fort and His Followers](https://amzn.to/4eXq9tX) )--*Side quest: put up a plaque?*
