**Premise:** Electronic rendition of [ragas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raga) (classical Indian music).  Because:  (i) interesting/programmable polyrythmic patterns ([taal](https://raag-hindustani.com/Rhythm.html)); (ii) ragas are something like a combination of mode and melody and framework for improvisation, which might be well suited for randomization/quantizing;(iii) drone sounds and glissandos of the [sitar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sitar) and tone varied thumping of tablas are well suited to analog synthesizers or programming; (iv) Not totally heretical, as [Raga rock/pop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raga_rock) exists; (v) amusing pun potential.  **Resources include...**


# Gadgets

* [Cynthia Voltage Controlled Tabla](https://www.modulargrid.net/c/cynthia-voltage-controlled-tabla)---*Two dozen classical rhythmic cycles of percussion or "Taals" can be selected either manually or by patch cord. (click on the keypad for a close-up)For example as Ravi Shankar at the Monterey Pop Festival explains an "Ek" type of taal is a cycle of 12 beats divided 4,4,2,2 A faster Ek Taal would be based on only six units and thus become 2,2,1,1. This Cynthiafied Tablatron uses digitally sampled recordings of real acoustic Tablas and allows you to voltage control the pitch, tone, and tempo, as well as use logic signals to cycle through dozens of taals.*
