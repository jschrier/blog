Following up on our [Make America Make Again]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2025-02-17-Make-America-Make-Again %}) post on manufacturing, **what about learning to make microchips?...**

# Online

- [Purdue Semiconductor 101](https://engineering.purdue.edu/online/programs/masters-degrees/semiconductors/semiconductor-fabrication-101) --- free online course...a bunch of videos, but includes a VR fabrication lab simulator ([VFabLab](https://vfablab.org/))
    - Feeds into their [Online MS in Microelectronics and Semiconductors](https://engineering.purdue.edu/online/programs/masters-degrees/semiconductors) program, which runs $43K.

- [Zero to ASIC course](https://www.zerotoasiccourse.com) --- roughly $1000.  learn [process development kit](https://www.zerotoasiccourse.com/terminology/pdk/) and design (and actually get fabricated) a digital circuit.  There's also an [analog ASIC sequel](https://www.zerotoasiccourse.com/analog/).  This is the game if your goal of making microchips is to be a Fabless cat.  

- **U Albany** has online/hybrid grad certificate courses in [Semiconductor Manufacturing](https://www.albany.edu/nanoscale-science-engineering/programs/cgs-semiconductor-manufacturing),  [Semiconductor Metrology](https://www.albany.edu/nanoscale-science-engineering/programs/cgs-semiconductor-metrology), and [Semiconductor Patterning & Processing](https://www.albany.edu/nanoscale-science-engineering/programs/cgs-semiconductor-patterning-processing). Generally about 3 courses each, so roughly [$6K for New York State residents](https://www.albany.edu/cost-aid/tuition-fees/online-students)

# In-Person (USA)

- [Maricopa Community College (in Arizona)](https://info.maricopacorporate.com/semiconductor) has a 10-day semiconductor technician quickstart course.  (roughly $400)

# In-Person (NY)

- [NY Creates](https://ny-creates.org/) --- based in Albany has a series of [workforce development](https://ny-creates.org/workforce-development/) programs around semiconductor manufacture. (I've put my name on the [Faculty Technical Development Workshop](https://ny-creates.org/workforce-development/faculty-technical-workshops/) mailing list for a few months, but haven't heard anything)

- [NORDTECH](https://www.nordtechub.org/) (Northeast Regional Defense Technology Hub) is, despite its name, focused on microelectronics rather than exothermic reactions. Consortium of universities and industry (and BNL) [facilities](https://www.nordtechub.org/facilities), mostly in New York.

# In-Person (NYC)

- [CUNY ASCR Nanofab](https://asrc.gc.cuny.edu/facilities/nanofabrication/) has gadgets, but training is unclear to me.  Maybe through one of the [MS in Nanoscience](https://www.gc.cuny.edu/nanoscience/curriculum-and-degree-requirements) lab courses?
