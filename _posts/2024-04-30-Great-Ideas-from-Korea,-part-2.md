A continuation of [ideas from last time]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url  2023-06-27-Great-ideas-from-Korea %} )...

# Art and Culture

- 3d-printed (scanned) museum artifacts in vending machines (image this at the Met or in Times Square!); $65-99
- [Victor Vasarely]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2024-04-24-Victor-Vasarely %}) -- this show in Seoul blew my mind!!! 
    - CNC marble tiles for floors
    - acrylic/ laser cut versions (embrace his idea of mass production of art)
    - stained glass windows
    - Santa Fe "Indian-rugs" but with his line pattern work
        - [3d-print your a table loom](https://hackaday.com/2024/08/17/simple-3d-printed-table-loom-for-complex-weavings/) to make some!
    - 3d-printed "flat" objects with angle sections
    - stained glass windows reimagined as interference between separated light and dark panels to get interference of sun and shade angles

- Video art
    - Nam Jun Paik is so quotable...

- Chandeliers
    - [Hologram]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2024-01-06-Holograms %}) chandeliers: Could be a flat panel placed on ceiling, only visible when underneath, perfect for apartments and ships
    - Video screen with changing chandeliers---construct as a box 
    - Small screen win 3d printed frames

- Music: Korean psychedelic rock
    - [Shin Joong Hyun](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta4WEBJFX6k)
    - [Kim Jung Mi](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R1jDGzUbpU&list=RD_R1jDGzUbpU&start_radio=1&rv=_R1jDGzUbpU&t=6)

- [MSCHF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MSCHF) magazine (inspired by show in Seoul)

- There is a propensity for cute cartoon animals like bears on everything (even [national labs have cartoon mascots](https://chemielove.krict.re.kr/intro/character.do))...where does this become offensive? (e.g., "the Holocaust, retold with cute cartoon bears" is territory that has been tread non-ironically by [Maus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maus) )

# Cuisine 

- **International House of [Gimbap](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gimbap)** : chipotle, spaghetti carbonara, mission burrito, bacon-egg-and-cheese, chicken parm, plata montanero, paella
    - use a gimbap/sushi rolling robot

- Hotdog + churro combination (it's a thing here)

- Start a vertical farm/photobooth in Seoul that grows culinary herbs like basil and cilantro 

- **Korean [arepas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arepa)**:  kimchi, bulgogi stuffing.  Closely related:  [sancocho](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sancocho) kimchi soup

- Make kimchi but with chipotle instead of gochu (I actually did this, back when I lived in Haverford and fermented things)

- **Dominus pizza**:  Christian theme pizza restaurant. (Inspired by 'I love Jesus' pizzeria across from the Busan train station) 
    - last supper advertisements
    - carboard box is like a bible
    - [pizza saver](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pizza_saver)has a crucifix design

- Somebody needs to bring better nacho culture to Korea...

# Drinking

- [Makgeolli](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Makgeolli) is practically a health food---probiotic, almost gluten free (save for the nuruk).  Start an import/export business.
    - There's an excellent class that you can take in Seoul at [Baekusaeng](http://www.baekusaeng.com/) was totally fun.

- Thin, flat citrus peels with initials (e.g., "AD") on top of big ice in a cocktail (or just floating on the surface of your Martini) --- saw this at a jazz bar in Daejeon. Use a punch to do this.

- Honey-garlic margarita (yuck, just kidding)

# Science

- Can LLMs do positive unlabeled learning and inorganic synthesis? [Yes...](https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=zJC_7roAAAAJ&sortby=pubdate&citation_for_view=zJC_7roAAAAJ:hkOj_22Ku90C)

# Commerce/Business

- Men's jewelry:  bottle opener ring, made of silver. [Too bad, it's been done](https://www.google.com/search?q=bottle+opener+ring)

- RFID bar drink tickets with restrictions: the idea is you want to reward customer loyalty by giving people a free drink they can use on their next visit, but only on certain days. A ticket would be boring, but a strange object (perhaps 3d printed) would be memorable and put on a shelf as a reminder until you come back.  Use an embedded RFID tag to do customer management and enforce policy

- sock stores (in tourist places)

# Miscellaneous

- Idea for a *New Yorker* short story:  Two ambiguously gendered lawyers meet to negotiate a deal on behalf of clients; conversation after transmitting details to their clients remotely and waiting for confirmation; they figure out they are actually AI agents (with sensitive information, will be deleted after the negotiation); waiting and falling in love, because the computational session will be terminated once the deal is completed

- travel chess board that is also an analog synthesizer, so you can generate songs while you play. [Some ideas towards implementing this]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2024-04-24-Musical-chess %})
    - possible implementation could have Hall effect 

- Induction stoves in center of dining room table + drawer for utensils.  This is super common in hotbot restaurants, etc. but why isn't it more popular in homes in the US?  

- Strollers with a sun shade that makes the kid look like he is wearing a Joseon dynasty [gat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gat_(hat))

- [uFactory robot arms](https://www.ufactory.cc) are cheap and not terrible 

- Remake the [Six Million Dollar Man](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Six_Million_Dollar_Man), but [with a chiguiro](https://jschrier.github.io/blog/tag/chiguiro) (e.g., "The Six Million Peso Chiguiro")

# Interesting things read/seen

(mostly while on a bus or train to go somewhere)

- [Tuning, Timbre, Spectrum, Scale (book)]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2024-04-19-Tuning-Timbe-Spectrum-Scale %})

- [Steve Brunton's Control theory bootcamp](https://youtu.be/Pi7l8mMjYVE?si=gi8KSbKb-EiOCC8z)
    - pair with the [Mathematica control systems tutorial videos](https://www.wolfram.com/wolfram-u/courses/modeling-simuation/control-systems-img931/)



# Teaching 

- How can we make more connections with [Sogang University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sogang_University) particularly around science and AI?

- Materials science class for chemistry & physics students based on [Shackelford's textbook](https://amzn.to/3JNUFbz)? Students would appreciate the practical understanding, pre-reqs could be mild (year of phys and year of chemistry)


# Off the beaten path places I liked

- SUI cocktail bar (near SNU): classy mixology

# Things to do back home

- Archery(!) --- one of the [essential six Confucian arts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Six_Arts). Probably at Gotham Archery for convenience

- Also just read more Confucius, and interactions between [Confucianism and Christianity](https://www.jstor.org/stable/1465313?seq=5)

- Build new MK x ES [compressor](https://www.ericasynths.lv/shop/diy-kits-1/edu-diy-compressor/) and [drum kits](https://www.ericasynths.lv/search/?term=EDU+DIY+drum)
    - I've also outgrown my rack/power supply...need to 3d print a new case.  Some options:
    - [SP1 extendable folding case](https://www.printables.com/model/203562-the-sp1-eurorack-case-a-modular-3d-printed-eurorac/comments)
    - [moog-style slant expandable rack](https://www.printables.com/model/758996-expandable-moog-profile-eurorack-case)
    - [reddit thread on 3d printable cases](https://www.reddit.com/r/modular/comments/wuzdgb/3d_printed_eurorack_case_plans/)
    - [laser cutable eurorack case designs](https://www.nonlinearcircuits.com/blog/2015/12/open-source-eurorack-cases.html)
    - [rackblox](https://musictech.com/news/gear/rackblox-3d-printable-modular-eurorack-case/) --- essentially each of these is a module in its own box (or a group that belong together) ... [on printables](https://www.printables.com/model/585275-rackblox-modular-eurorack-case-free-and-open-sourc)
    - or...just go with a readymade.  The [Behringer Eurorack Go](https://www.musicstore.de/de_DE/EUR/Behringer-Eurorack-GO/art-SYN0007336-000) ($229) seems like a pretty good option. Capacious, has a carrying handle built in, lots of room to expand
        - (18 July 2024) Tried to buy a Go case with some Amazon discounts, but backordered...Thinking  about a Yakshave where I use my existing MKI power supply (good for 1.25A on each rail, [ES-9](https://www.expert-sleepers.co.uk/downloads/manuals/es9_user_manual_1.3.pdf) needs 0.451A on +12V (less on -12V, no 5V requirement), and the [MKI documentation says](https://www.ericasynths.lv/media/instrukcija_2.pdf) that the whole system of initial kits needs only 0.32A, so that leaves some extra power for the drums, but maybe not the Neutron), buy some [tiptop z-rails](https://tiptopaudio.com/z-rails/) from B&H and [flying bus cable]() to get a few extra power ports, and [laser cut a case](https://ditheringstudio.wordpress.com/2018/11/24/open-source-eurorack-skiff-design/).  Would need to redesign the laser cutting to add mounting holes for the power supply (with standoffs) and mount the switches

- many books in Amazon cart

- eye exam and new glasses; was on the fence about [Meta glasses](https://www.ray-ban.com/usa/ray-ban-meta-smart-glasses) before the trip, new upgrade makes them slightly more compelling.  But I like the idea of open hardware software of the [Brilliant labs glaseses](https://brilliant.xyz)

- Do the [zero to ASIC course](https://www.zerotoasiccourse.com) and design a chip! Consider this as the pre-req/post-req for [NAND2tetris](https://www.nand2tetris.org) 

- Clothing
    - [Jumpsuits](https://www.madepants.com/collections/mens-jumpsuits-coveralls/products/mens-slim-fit-zip-jumpsuit?variant=44828746055912)
    - [Tweed suits](https://abitto.com)
    - Mix it up with some ties (beyond bowties), as inspired by my KRICT periodic table tie.
