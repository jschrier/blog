I saw some work by [August Muth](https://www.augustmuth.com/about) in the [Vladem Contemporary](https://www.augustmuth.com/about), which turned me on to holography.  **Resources...** 

# (Active) Museums

- [Holographic Studios](https://holographer.com) NYC (26th st btwn 2nd & 3rd ave)---offers tours (by appointment) and classes
- [Center for Holographic Arts](http://holocenter.org/) in [Kingston (upstate), NY](https://maps.app.goo.gl/j8iBeavh2YxUffMx8) (2 hr drive, 3-4 hour train/bus from NYC)
- [Light Foundry](https://www.facebook.com/thelightfoundryinc) in Santa Fe. August Muth's studio.  Very limited info.

# Training/Schools

- [International School of Holography](https://www.internationalschoolofholography.com) offers online courses

# Books

- Harper, [Holography Projects for the Evil Genius](https://amzn.to/3tI1mr1) -- seems approachable for garage tinkerers
- Kasper & Feller, [The Complete Book of Holograms](https://amzn.to/3TLMnHl) -- i have a soft spot for Dover books.  Mostly based on geometric/physical arguments, and some practical information
- Unterseher, Hansen, & Schlesinger, [Holography Handbook](https://amzn.to/48kO5E7) --- great 1990s Berkeley publication...emphasis on practical details (setting up a darkroom and lab is the first 100+ pages) rather than theory
- Poon & Liu, [Introduction to Modern Digital Holography: With Matlab](https://amzn.to/3S5VpO7) --- appears highly technical/mathematical.  Of course, we'll implement it in Mathematica instead :-) 

# Holographics Art and Artists

- [Deana Lawson Exhibit at Gugenheim  2021](https://www.guggenheim.org/articles/checklist/holography-how-artists-sculpt-with-light-space-and-time) -- along with a history of holographic art
- [Holography as an art medium (1989)](https://www.jstor.org/stable/i270951?mag=the-rise-and-fall-of-hologram-art)


# Gadgets

- [LitiHolo](https://www.litiholo.com/3d-hologram-printer.html) print holograms
- [LookingGlass Factory](https://lookingglassfactory.com) digital light-field display---send your Unity/Blender/etc. models to this to view.  Small size is $300, large montiors available. Based in BK
