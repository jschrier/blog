Invovles critical readings of literature and politics of European [alt-right](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alt-right/ [New Right](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_New_Right) movements in Europe) 

# Reading List

## Ur-Texts

- Spengler 1918/22, [*Der Untergang des Abendlandes* (The Decline of the West)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Decline_of_the_West) --- as a sort of ur-text for this idea.  [Project Gutenberg](https://gutenberg.org/ebooks/author/56648) has vol 1 in english, and both volumes in German
- Spengler 1933, [*Jahre der Entscheidung. Deutschland und die weltgeschichtliche Entwicklung* (The Hour of Decision: Germany and World-Historical Evolution)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hour_of_Decision) --- introduce the idea of "downward" (class) and "outward" (ethnic) threats. [Routledge has an English edition](https://www.routledge.com/Routledge-Revivals-The-Hour-of-Decision-1934-Germany-and-World-Historical-Evolution/Spengler/p/book/9781138289482)

## Some history

- Ibrahim 2018, [Sword and Scimitar: Fourteen Centuries of War between Islam and the West ](https://amzn.to/4pIzrz0) --- set up historical context for references to Siege of Constantinople, Battle of Tours, Siege of Vienna, referred to in other documents, although the author has a clear axe to grind (which is itself teachable/relevant)

## The Post Cold-War Era

- Fukuyama 1992, [The End of History and the Last Man](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_End_of_History_and_the_Last_Man) --- Yay, the Cold War is over. Western liberal democratic ideals for the win! (as a counterpoint to what follows...)
- Barber 1995, [Jihad versus McWorld](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jihad_vs._McWorld). "No, no Fukuyama: Tribal forces are going to rebel against your globalized neoliberal order." 
- Huntington 1996, [The Clash of Civilizations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clash_of_Civilizations). "No, no Fukuyama:  Not every ethno-pan-national bloc is compatible with western values."  There's a vast [critical literature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clash_of_Civilizations#Criticism) for students to select from to create in class presentations/debates.

## Political motivators

(probably too much to assign all of these, so just have students pick one and discuss in class. Bonus points if they can use their language requirement pre-reqs to read in the original)

- Buchanan 2001 [The Death of the West](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Death_of_the_West) --- American perspective
- Sarrazin 2010, [Deutschland schafft sich ab: Wie wir unser Land aufs Spiel setzen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany_Abolishes_Itself) --- basically a german flavored version
- Zemmour 2014 [Le Suicide français](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_French_Suicide) --- a french version

## Demographic shifts and population decline

- UN Report (2000) [Replacement Migration: Is it A Solution to Declining and Ageing Populations?](https://www.un.org/development/desa/pd/sites/www.un.org.development.desa.pd/files/unpd-egm_200010_un_2001_replacementmigration.pdf) --- fertility declines, migration trends.  **Research Activity:** Retroactive look back at the accuracy of the various prediction scenarios.

## Fictional treatments and themes (popular reception)

- Raspail 1973, [Le Camp des Saints (The Camp of the Saints)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Camp_of_the_Saints) ---  the classic dystopian migrant crisis/failure of the western ideals narrative
- James 1992, [The Children of Men](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Children_of_Men) --- what does a country look like when it doesn't have any more children
     - [Film: Children of Men (2006)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Children_of_Men) --- based on the novel (above), different. More of an emphasis on migration. Compare and contrast.
- Houellebecq 2015, [Soumission (Submission)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Submission_(novel)) --- like all Houllebecq novels, deliciously depressing misanthropy. Notice how the protagonist's escape route from Paris travels echoes the *Camp of Saints*, involves a stop at the shrine of Charles Martel, etc.  
    - This (or Sarrazin's book, *vide supra*) could also be used as a launching point into critical discussions of [Eurabia conspiracy theories](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurabia_conspiracy_theory), and tracing out how these ideas spread through social media.
