While wasting time reading *Phys Rev E*, I came across a recent article by [Jesse Berezovsky](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=fd7xfR4AAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate) on [Renormalization-group approach to ordered phases in music (2024)](https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevE.110.014145), which in turn lead me to the author's earlier work [The structure of musical harmony as an ordered phase of sound: A statistical mechanics approach to music theory (2019)](https://doi.org/10.1126/sciadv.aav8490).  The core idea of the latter is to use a [Sethares-style dissonance function](({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2024-04-19-Tuning-Timbe-Spectrum-Scale %})) as the internal energy and then minimize the [Helmholtz free energy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helmholtz_free_energy).  This is plausible because it describes an optimization between pattern (low energy) and variety (entropy) in music. [Bereezovsky's website has example compositions](http://jablab2.case.edu/music.htm) generated by this approach. And poking around on his google scholar, he has a [2024 March Meeting abstract on rhythm](https://meetings.aps.org/Meeting/MAR24/Session/G31.11)...having not seen the talk, I would speculate about treating this as like an Ising model/step-sequencer with some interaction.
