Some useful tools and tricks:
* Creating this with [Github pages](https://github.com/skills/github-pages)
* Using [M2MD](https://github.com/kubaPod/M2MD/wiki) to facilitate conversion of Mathematica notebooks into Markdown
* (Although tempting to use [Wolfdown](https://github.com/paul-jean/wolfdown), there are a bunch of hardcoded options which were harder to parse)
* How to add tags?  Ordinarily Jekyll requires some add ons, but [this post describes how to do it with default github pages](http://longqian.me/2017/02/09/github-jekyll-tag/).  I didn't have much luck, but one day I'll figure it out.
