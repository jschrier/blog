**Goal:** I have a few MIDI keyboards mouldering in the house and a newly built (by me) [Erica/MKI modular synthesizer](https://www.hackster.io/fhdm-dev/use-arduino-libraries-with-the-rasperry-pi-pico-c-c-sdk-eff55c?f=1), but no way to get them to talk to one another.  So let's build a device which will generate output control voltages.  The premise is to read in MIDI signals, use a RP2040 microcontroller to interpret the commands, and then use a D2A converter to output the relevant control voltages.
**Status**: Parts arrived.

# Precedent/previous work

[AxWax has a two-part series](https://axwax.eu/series/raspberry-pi-pico-as-midi-to-cv-converter/) describing a build like this.   In his first episode he generates a control voltage (CV) (and uses the direct output from a RP2040 GPIO pin as the trigger).  In the second episode he expands this to generate two CV outputs and reads from some sensors.  This is a good starting point for our project 

Like me, he uses an RP2040 and has a [python-based code posted online](https://gist.github.com/axwax/84dc05a1966a788cd8e69e324a0757d2). It uses the [SimpleMIDIDecoder.py](https://github.com/diyelectromusic/sdemp/blob/main/src/SDEMP/Micropython/SimpleMIDIDecoder.py) library.
    
Areas where I want to do things differently: (i) use a pre-build MIDI interface (with the optocoupler already incorporated); (ii) use a Quad D2A rather than use a dual...because...why not!   But otherwise, this is a solid starting point

Some areas to pursue for the future
* Software-defined LFO (just shape the control voltage)
* Interesting software-defined sequencers
* Get power from a Eurorack?  For now just run it off the USB serial power.
