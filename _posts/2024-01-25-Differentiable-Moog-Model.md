Combining two of the interests of this blog---analog synthesizers and machine learning---Uzrad et al [DiffMoog: a Differentiable Modular Synthesizer for Sound Matching](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12570) is a differentiable model of all the parts in a typical analog synthesizer.  Because it is differentiable, it can be incorporated into a neural network allowing for automatic sound matching/replicating an audio input. Code on [Github](https://github.com/aisynth/diffmoog).
