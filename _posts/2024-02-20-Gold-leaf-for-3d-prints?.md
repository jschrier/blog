Can you apply gold-leaf to 3d-prints? **Yes...**

# Tutorials on Gold Leaf for 3D prints

Essentially, you don't have to do anything differently from how you would apply gold leaf to any other surface.  Ideally you sand and prime the surface (layer lines will be visible otherwise), then apply size, then brush on your leaf and burnish if needed

- [Applying silver leaf to a print](https://www.instructables.com/Silver-Leaf-a-3D-Print/)
    - Use Speedball metal leaf and adhesive products
    - Seal with Tamiya model paint matte enamel clear 
- [another example](https://cyborgworkshop.org/2016/05/16/gilding-3d-prints/) using fake gold leaf

# Marble PLA

- [Review of MarblePLA filaments (2023)](https://all3dp.com/2/marble-pla-marble-filament-brands-compared/)...maybe consider a hardened nozzle, although it is not so abrasive

# Prototyping

- Use 3d printed structures to prototype, before proceeding to marble CNC.  Study angular dependence of view and reflections.
