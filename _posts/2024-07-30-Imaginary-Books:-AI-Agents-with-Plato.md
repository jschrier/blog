**Premise:** Learn how to develop agentic LLM systems by building characters in Platonic dialogues...

**Backstory:** Stimulated by watching some [CrewAI framework](https://www.crewai.com) videos on [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/learn/multi-ai-agent-systems-with-crewai/) 

**Concept:** Following in the interpretation that Plato's dialogues are intended to show "how to do philosophy" (in contrast to "doctrinal" or "esoteric" readings), we can see the characters as agents working together.  Our approach is probably closest [Byrd's "summoner" reading of the dialogues](https://muse.jhu.edu/pub/1/article/218270) (inspired by the *parakaloÅ«nta* in Republic 522a) where they are intended to present the soul with contradictions for the sake of inducing the reader to formulate a higher hypothesis.  But it might also have the sort of Tubingen-style reading that dialogue form is chosen specifically to present a model of ideal oral discourse.

**Implementation:** Inspired by Farnsworth's [Socratic Method: A Practitioner's Guide](https://amzn.to/3LJxpMI), outline some core ideas of implementing multi-agent design patterns from scratch and then illustrate them with excerpts from the dialogues.  In a step-by-step way, we build up the techniques in some framework ([CrewAI](https://www.coursera.org/learn/multi-ai-agent-systems-with-crewai/ungradedLti/vfZJg/multi-ai-agent-systems-with-crewai) or [Autogen](https://www.coursera.org/learn/ai-agentic-design-patterns-with-autogen/ungradedLti/cbvCd/ai-agentic-design-patterns-with-autogen)), but also an understanding of the motivations and ideas of the characters.

1. Basic single-agent outputs:  Mimic dialogues which have primarily just one speaker (whether Socrates or someone else)
2. Interactions: Build on the classic dialetic techniques outlined in Farnsworth
3. Interaction with Lean theorem proving: Recreating the *Meno* proof

# Parerga and Paralipomena

- (10 Feb 2025) Rajeev Assary  & co. have a preprint out on [The Hitchhiker's Guide to Socratic Methods in Prompting Large Language Models for Chemistry Applications](https://doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-djf43) which unpacks this idea a bit more
  - Digging into the references, it in turn largely draws upon a framework by Chang 2024 [Prompting Large Language Models With the Socratic Method](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.08769)
