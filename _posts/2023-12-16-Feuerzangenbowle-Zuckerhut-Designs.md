I love to make a good [Feuerzangenbowle](https://thewinegetter.com/2015/02/10/feuerzangenbowle-and-how-to-make-your-own-zuckerhut/) for my annual holiday party, but in the USA, [zuckerhutte are expensive](https://amzn.to/3uVXJhz).  Fortunately, it is easy to make your own (1 tsp water + 1 cup of sugar...pack into a conical glass).  But cone shapes are boring. If you are going to make your own, why not come up with other designs? **Ideas for hipster zuckerhut designs...**

- [Joan of Arc](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joan_of_Arc) at the stake
- [Saint Lawrence, Deacon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_Lawrence) on his gridiron. Patron saint of Barbeque.
- [Self-immolating Buddhist monk seated in meditation](https://rarehistoricalphotos.com/the-burning-monk-1963/)
- [Burning Man](https://images.app.goo.gl/PJswJ18iwJQ5UQJc6) / [Zozobra](https://burnzozobra.com)
- [Sacred Heart of Jesus on Fire](https://aleteia.org/2022/06/21/why-is-the-sacred-heart-on-fire/)
- [Burning bush](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burning_bush)...keep it ecumenical
- [Library of Alexandria](https://images.app.goo.gl/v196qZXdjnqgybAP8)...just a classical building...on fire
- [Dante's Infero](https://images.app.goo.gl/oynhPf4LnhYRR4M47)...sort of an inverted zuckerhut with the different levels.
    - Or just go with devils with pitchforks.
- [Dresden cityscape](https://images.app.goo.gl/HjbTfmWdJQTdACXx8)...with hats off to my neighbor [Kurt Vonnegut](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slaughterhouse-Five); 
    - Other possible iconic cityscapes could be [Paris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris_Is_Burning_(film)), [London](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London%27s_Burning_(The_Clash_song)), [Chicago](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Chicago_Fire), [Rome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Fire_of_Rome), or just [burning down the house](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burning_Down_the_House)
- Burning pile of books (or maybe just one book)
- [Hernan Cortez burning his ships upon landing in Mexico](https://www.jstor.org/stable/335707) 

# Fabrication methods

- **Casting** is probably the best way. Make a silicone mold and go to town
    - [youtube tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZasLw05KpA) on sugar casting
    - likely have to be a multipart mold for these complicated shapes.
- **3d printing** ...essentially do [powder-bed fusion](https://www.lboro.ac.uk/research/amrg/about/the7categoriesofadditivemanufacturing/powderbedfusion/), but with sugar instead of metal (and the heat source is more modest)
    - [Currant3D](https://currant3d.com/currant-3d-printer) sells a professionally rated food 3d printer...  They also do [production on demand](https://currant3d.com/3d-printed-food). Corporate parent is [SugarLab](https://sugarlab3d.com/pages/tech). They're based in LA.
    - **Open question:** Will these types of printed sugar structures maintain their structural integrity upon being doused with high-proof rum?  Maybe we need to experiment
    - [Candyfab](https://candyfab.org/#cf6k) old-school DIY project, just for fun to look at, not really production rated.
