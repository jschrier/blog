Saw an epic [Alan Saret](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Saret) [show at Karma](https://karmakarma.org/exhibitions/alan-saret-ny-2024/) today.  I really dig his [geometric works](https://alan-saret.com/thumbnails-go.html).  Skip down to "Ring 1" to [see the works in the exhibition](https://karmakarma.org/exhibitions/alan-saret-ny-2024/works/) (the calligraphy is alright, but I wasn't into any of the figurative drawings). *Octaspiral* and *Special Relationship With Joyful Incircles* are some of my favorites
