Saw an epic [Alan Saret](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Saret) [show at Karma](https://karmakarma.org/exhibitions/alan-saret-ny-2024/) today.  I really dig his [geometric works](https://alan-saret.com/thumbnails-go.html).  Skip down to "Ring 1" to [see the works in the exhibition](https://karmakarma.org/exhibitions/alan-saret-ny-2024/works/) (the calligraphy is alright, but I wasn't into any of the figurative drawings). *Octaspiral* and *Special Relationship With Joyful Incircles* are some of my favorites...

# Parerga and Paralipomena

- Some of the Monir Shahroudy Farmanfarmaian, Yasi Alipour, and Safdar Ali Qureshi pieces in the [Delicately Does It group show at AICON](https://www.aicon.art/exhibitions/delicately-does-it) (seen later, but also still on) have some nice resonance and it would be cool to co-exhibit them. The IMAGINE pieces would also play well with Saret's calligraphy sub-exhibit. (another great show)

- Seeing this show made [Crayonfou](http://crayonfou.com) want a [spirograph](https://www.printables.com/model/276288-spirograph) so I [fired up the ole' Prusa](https://jschrier.github.io/blog/tag/3dprinting) when I got home.
