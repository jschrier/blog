Want to make black images that are fused into the glaze of white tile (or into clear glass) with your CO2 laser?  **The Norton White Tile Method is what you are looking for...**

# Chemical premise

- A thin coating of rutile TiO2 is deposited on a glazed ceramic and/or glass surface.
- Application of heat using an IR or diode laser converts the anatase crystal form into the anatase crystal form, while simultaneously fusing it into the glaze oxide
- This results in a black (anatase) marking which is fused into the glaze and thus resistant to photobleaching, scratching, etc.

- [rschoen](https://www.instructables.com/A-New-Way-to-Laser-Engrave-Glass/) describes the use of a 2 parts water:  1 part Elmer's glue: 2 parts TiO2 powder (with an optional few drops of food coloring dye) applied by brush in one or two coats. He uses an ordinary lens and draws vector images on glass

- [Omtech describes the traditional Norton White Tile Method](https://omtechlaser.com/blogs/tips/how-to-laser-engrave-ceramic-tiles-norton-white-tile-method); they recommend the use of a compound engraving lens to get smaller dots.  Specifically they (specific for the manufacturer?) state that  a 
"universal focal lens  (typically 1.5” or 2”) ... create a typical dot size of around 0.25mm when focused ... approximately 100dpi. ... [A] Compound Engraving Lens... can achieve a dot size of 0.1mm — capable of engraving a 254DPI image" (**comment: this seems like a nice-to-have, not need-to-have**). They also recommend either using spray paint or using an airbrush to apply "2 tablespoons of [TiO2] powder with 4 fl oz of ethanol and shake thoroughly before and during application".  They recommend two coats, applied after rotating 90 degrees.

# Around the web

- [Corvus Moon recommends](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tffEH2fdm9o) using Rustoleum White Inverted Marking spray---he claims is water soluble. (**Caveat: This is not what Rustolem product sheet says...**) Jeffrey Court white bathroom tile from Home Depot or Mohawk Bathroom tile from USA. (The glazes work well). Use 90% isopropyl alcohol to clean the surface of the tile, then spray 3 light coats of the marking spray. Let dry for 15-20 minutes (coating is chalky, don't touch the surface). [imag-r.com](https://imag-r.com) can be helpful for dithering in a way that is appropriate for Norton While Tile method. Wash with soap and water.  19% power on a 10W laser
- [Lasers and Saws recommends](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwjCYH2iQF8). 50% (by volume) isopropyl alcohol and TiO2 powder in a spray bottle. You want a very fine mist. Use glass cleaner to clean the tile. Then spray and let it dry for 5 minutes. Apply more coats until it is dry and flat. Run a power scale test. Then just clean it with a toothbrush and water. 
- [RDWorks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwujeITphFs) found that a 1/3 to 2/3 (by volume) TiO2: Isopropyl alcohol mix airbrushed nicely

# Procedure

1. Clean the surface of the tile with 90% isopropyl alcohol

2. Apply two coats of TiO2-based paint (either by spraying or coating)

3. Laser engrave a test pattern 

4. Clean the surface under running water, using a toothbrush.



# Safety analysis

- [Michigan State University has an extensive webpage on TiO2 safety](https://www.canr.msu.edu/news/what-s-the-risk-titanium-dioxide).  
- TiO2 is not chemically toxic (it is used in powdered sugar, cosmetics, and sunscreen), but the powder is a potential inhalation hazard.  This is generally from [chronic exposure of large quantities, typically in an industrial setting is associated with lung cancer](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21456955/) 
- The use of water-based solvents for depositing the TiO2 on the surface avoids the risks associated with lasering paints.
- PPE: When preparing mixtures with TiO2 powder, wear a dust mask to avoid inhalation.  
- The amount of TiO2 vaporized during the laser process is minimal.
    - There is no specific metal fume toxicity associated with TiO2. [see reference article on metal fume toxicity](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20108830/)
    - [Metal fume fever](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metal_fume_fever) is typically associated with Zn, Al, Mg, Cu, Cd, Pb
    - (There is an isolated reports of [acute titanium toxicity associated with titanium ethanolate exposure](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7767615/), but this is a highly reactive liquid used in chemical
- Cleaning the surface with isopropyl alcohol has typical ventilation, skin contact, and flamability hazards.  
- Application of spray paint has usual associated ventillation safety precautions.
- Use of laser engraving has usual associated safety precautions. Tile substrate is non-flammable.
- Post-engraving cleanup is conducted in water. There is no contact toxicity of TiO2, but it is recommended to use gloves when washing the surface.
