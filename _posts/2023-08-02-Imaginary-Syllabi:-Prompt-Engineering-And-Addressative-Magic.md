*Premise:*  An introduction to [prompt engineering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prompt_engineering) by exploring analogies to magic (defined as "ritual meant to effect changes in the world")... 

(continuing the theme of [courses that teach generative AI in strange ways]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2023-07-08-Imaginary-Syllabi:-Athanasius-Kircher-and-Generative-AI %}) )

# Voces Magicae = Glitch Tokens

[Voces magicae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voces_magicae) (or their Greek cousin, [Ephesia Grammata](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ephesia_Grammata)) are pronounceable but nonsensical/meaningless words that have power to perform actions (if pronounced correctly) in greco-roman magical practice.

Explore the parallel to [glitch tokens](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/aPeJE8bSo6rAFoLqg/solidgoldmagikarp-plus-prompt-generation) and [more glitch tokens](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/kmWrwtGE9B9hpbgRT/a-search-for-more-chatgpt-gpt-3-5-gpt-4-unspeakable-glitch)

# Hekhalot mysticism = Escape characters

[Hekhalot mysticism](https://shwep.net/podcast/palaces-of-heavenly-wisdom-the-hekhalot-and-merkavah-traditions/) in proto-rabbinic Judaism involved cosmic ascents with special magical passwords needed to bypass guardians along the way. (Unlike the [Platonic ascent narratives](https://shwep.net/podcast/nowhere-to-go-but-up-philosophic-ascent-in-plato/) that just require making good decisions and being virtuous...)  If you do this, you gain secret knowledge about the way the universe works.

It was recently discovered that entering a thousand repeated letters ("a a a a ....") may cause ChatGPT to [spit out other users' chats](https://twitter.com/nostalgebraist/status/1686576041803096065) ... a magical password that bypasses the guardians

# Addressative Magic = Prompt Engineering

There is a long tradition of Judeo-Christian magic (e.g., [Sefer ha-Razim](https://shwep.net/podcast/exploring-the-sefer-ha-razim/), the [Testament of Solomon](https://shwep.net/podcast/the-testament-of-solomon-and-the-solomonic-tradition/), [etc.](https://shwep.net/podcast/the-testament-of-solomon-and-the-solomonic-tradition-part-ii/)) concerning the proper way to command angels and daemons to do your bidding---mostly by knowing their correct name, but also by being able to define an airtight contract with them

What is this, if not [prompt engineering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prompt_engineering)? 

# É solo un Trucco! From magic to natural magic to science...

(with reference to [La Grand Bellezza](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Great_Beauty)...[É solo un Trucco!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOF_YCcg8OM) ) 

An [exploration of the evolution of the category of of natural magic in the late-medieval to early modern period](https://link.springer.com/referenceworkentry/10.1007/978-3-319-02848-4_956-1), being sure to stops along the way for Aquinas' [De operationibus occultis naturae](https://isidore.co/aquinas/OperatOccult.htm)

It's just a trick.  There's no magic.  [It's just linear algebra.](https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2023/02/what-is-chatgpt-doing-and-why-does-it-work/)   How might an understanding of "natural magic" assist us in thinking about this and understanding societal responses?  Use the historical ways that society has treated magic in the past as a way to think about possible ways society will respond and regulate generative AI.

# Fordham Stuff

* [Jude Jones in the Philosophy department](https://www.fordham.edu/info/20945/philosophy_faculty_students_and_staff/7343/judith_jones) has ocasionally taught a course on [Harry Potter and Philosophy](https://fordhamobserver.com/32456/london/a-cup-of-tea-with-a-spoonful-of-magic/) and might be into this
* Run this as an [Interdisciplinary Capstone course](https://bulletin.fordham.edu/undergraduate/fordham-college-core-curriculum/capstone-courses/) --- history, religion, philosophy, computer stuff
