[Jay Hineman](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=wtcFMGEAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao) brought to my attention the mathematician [Doron Zeilberger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doron_Zeilberger).  Zeilberger is an [ultrafinitist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultrafinitism) working in experimental mathematics.  He has some interesting [opinions](https://sites.math.rutgers.edu/~zeilberg/OPINIONS.html)....among which, making me want to read more about [Sylvester](https://sites.math.rutgers.edu/~zeilberg/Opinion75.html)...and the pernicious greek tradition of mathematics[1](https://sites.math.rutgers.edu/~zeilberg/Opinion184.html)[2](https://sites.math.rutgers.edu/~zeilberg/Opinion174.html) 

He provides some book recommendations:
- [Tim Gowers: Mathematics, A Very Short Introduction](https://amzn.to/43A2w5k)
- [Proof! How the world became Geometrical](https://amzn.to/43CYx8j)
- [James Joseph Sylvester: Jewish Mathematician in a Victorian World](https://amzn.to/3PG7OGG)
