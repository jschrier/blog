Digging the artwork of [Herbert Franke](https://art-meets-science.io/en/herbert-w-franke-overview-work/), who started making [analog electronic art in the 1950s](https://art-meets-science.io/en/experimental-aesthetics-1959/) then migrated to video and digital.  I learned about him from a [post on stack exchange](https://mathematica.stackexchange.com/questions/301335/electronic-einstein-reproducing-herbert-w-frankes-dissolving-images)
