# Required readings

* Edward Thorp, [Beat the Dealer](https://amzn.to/3GXL8g7) --- classic about blackjack
* John Nunn, [Learn Chess](https://amzn.to/3D5UR2H) --- or maybe just have students sign up for a membership on [Chess.com](https://www.chess.com) and crank through the video lessons?
* JÃ¶rg Bewersdorff, [Luck, Logic, and White Lies](https://amzn.to/3HiVEjn) --- semi-mathematical treatment of a continuum of games as a combination of probability, logic, and bluffing; an alternative might be Epstein [The Theory of Gambling and Statistical Logic](https://amzn.to/3J7DLFG) which is a bit more textbook like, but doesn't cover logic/bluffing style games in depth
* Luke Rhinehart, [The Dice Man](https://amzn.to/3Wydsvg) --- cult classic novel about a psychologist who decides to let dice throws govern his life choices
* Stefan Zweig, [Schachnovelle / The Royal Game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Royal_Game) ---take a guess.
* Asa Hoffmann, [The Last Gamesman](https://amzn.to/3JfiCcq) --- autobiographical memoir of New York Chess player and master of Backgammon, Poker, Scrabble, Bridge, and Horse handicapping
* Adam Kucharski, [The Perfect Bet](https://amzn.to/3XQs8XC) --- popular book on the history of probability and its relationship to gambling
* Jacques Monod, [Chance and Necessity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chance_and_Necessity) --- a molecular biologist's take on Heraclitus' dictum that "Everything existing in the universe is the fruit of chance and necessity" 

# Optional readings

* Presh Talwar, [The Joy of Game Theory](https://amzn.to/3ZXPFrt) --- essays about game theory topics for a popular audience
* Ken Binmore, [Playing for Real: A Text on Game Theory](https://amzn.to/3iXl7Wk) --advanced undergraduate course on game theory for economists and social scientists
* William Poundstone [Fortune's Formula](https://amzn.to/3wk1N8D) --- popular work on the Kelly criterion, with a side helping of Edward Thorp and Claude Shannon
* Poker?  
* Modern approaches to beating roulette sourced from a ([Bloomberberg 2023 article](https://archive.ph/7CmWl))---cross ref to books [The Eudaimonic Pie](https://amzn.to/3GuKAPl) and [Follow the Bouncing Ball](https://amzn.to/3nXo3Ek) 
* Relative role of chance and skill in sports.  [SIAM News summary](https://www.siam.org/publications/siam-news/articles/feeling-lucky-the-relative-roles-of-skill-and-chance-in-sports/), links back to a [2018 SIAM Review article analyzing fantasy sports](https://doi.org/10.1137/16M1102094).  Core idea is to use the difference in win rates in the first and second half of the season to quantify skill. Interesting connection to the law: gambling laws apply when chance prevails, and so this has a regulatory consequence.
* Roeder, [Seven Games: A Human History](https://amzn.to/4hzwuO8) (2022) --- a history of Checkers, backgammon, chess, and Go. Poker, Scrabble, and bridge and discussion of why their rules make them interesting/fun (*24 Oct 2024*)
