*Premise:*  An interdisciplinary course in ceramic glazes as art/chemistry...

# Science motivations

- Sitting on a panel on structural ceramics
- Thinking about the develop of new glazes as a thermodynamic prediction problem...

# Reading List

- [Ceramic Science for the Potter](https://books.google.com/books/about/Ceramic_Science_for_the_Potter.html?id=JlgqAAAACAAJ) ... out of print...
    - Bloomfeld [Science for Potters](https://amzn.to/4aXrjm3)...might be a reasonable substitute
- Eppler, [Understanding Glazes](https://www.wiley.com/en-cn/Understanding+Glazes-p-9781574982220) ... looks like a solid materials chemistry textbook

# Similar courses

- Online course on [Understanding Glazes](https://ceramicmaterialsworkshop.com/courses/understanding-glazes.html)

# Fordham stuff

- Would make an interesting interdisciplinary capstone course, but nobody in the visual arts program appears to do ceramics...maybe a collaboration with [Lehman College](https://lehman-undergraduate.catalog.cuny.edu/departments/ART-LEH/courses)
