**Can you using an [Ising model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ising_model) to make music?...**

You can listen to an example on their [github](https://github.com/QC-DESY/qeyboard_and_isingsound_resources/tree/main)...kind of theremin-y sound.

Listening to Phase Transitions in the Ising and Potts Model](https://www.academia.edu/70676491/Sonification_of_Spin_Models_Listening_to_Phase_Transitions_in_the_Ising_and_Potts_Model) --- more of a pedagogical tool for physics students, rather than a musical composition tool
