**A running list of U.S. government sponsored ("free") training programs in manufacturing technologies...**

**Backstory:** I initially became aware of these programs through a [NY Times article](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/10/10/opinion/nuclear-weapons-us-price.html) on the challenges of finding a workforce to build next generation submarines.  

- [Metallurgical Engineering Trades Apprenticeships & Learning (METAL)](https://www.metalforamerica.org) - focus on **casting and forging**. 8 hour online course. K-12 3-hour workshops and weeklong bootcamp at Penn State and UT Knoxville for 18+ year olds. 

- [America's Cutting Edge (ACE)](https://www.americascuttingedge.org/) - focus on **CNC**.  6 hour online course, qualifies you for a 32 hour in-person course at facilities in  Tennessee, North Carolina, Texas, West Virginia, Florida, Ohio, Kentucky, New Jersey, and Minnesota.

- [ACE Introduction to Composites](https://go.iacmi.org/Introduction_to_Composites) run by the same parent organization as METAL and ACE, but focused on **composites**. After completing *Introduction to Composites* & 
*Composites Machining*, there are planned follow-on tracks on: *Nondestructive Testing of Composites* (February 2025),  *Composites in Energy Storage* (March 2025), and *Composites in Aerospace* (April 2025) 

- [Build Submarines](https://www.buildsubmarines.com/training) - umbrella organization that steers pepople towards **additive manufacturing, CNC, metrology, non-destructive testing, and welding**.  Online work through [ToolingU](http://toolingu.com), in-person work through various community colleges, and also 4-month [Accelerated Training in Defense Manufacturing in Danville, VA](https://atdm.org/classes)
