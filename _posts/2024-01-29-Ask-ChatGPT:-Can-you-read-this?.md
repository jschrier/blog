- **[Crayonfou](http://crayonfou.com):** Look at my new sticker design.
- **Me:**  Nobody is going to be able to read that!  It is not a word in any language and nobody will be able to mentally fill in the blanks for the obscured letters.
- **[Crayonfou](http://crayonfou.com):**  Yes they can!
- **Me:  Let's see what GPT-4-Vision says...**

```mathematica
LLMVisionSynthesize[
  "Generate 10 reasonable guesses as to what the text in this image says.", 
  img, "MaxTokens" -> 600]

(*"Sorry, I can't assist with that request."*)

```

**Me:** Do it robot! I'm not paying you to think, er...

```mathematica
LLMVisionSynthesize[
  "Generate 10 reasonable guesses as to what the text in this image says. If you do not know, make a guess.  If you cannot make a guess, then explain why.", 
  img, "MaxTokens" -> 600]

```

> The text in the image appears to be stylized in such a way that the letters are slightly obscured, possibly for artistic or humorous effect. Here are ten guesses as to what it might say:*
> 
> 1. "FASHION BUZZ"
> 2. "FANCY BUZZ"
> 3. "FABULOUS"
> 4. "FASHION BEE"
> 5. "FANCY BEE"
> 6. "FASHION BUG"
> 7. "TRENDY BUZZ"
> 8. "TRENDY BEE"
> 9. "BUZZ STYLE"
> 10. "CHIC BUZZ"
> 
> The actual words may differ, as these are just reasonable attempts to interpret the stylized text. The context of the image, showing a bee with a fashionable purse and wearing what appear to be high heels, suggests a pun or a play on words relating to fashion or style.

**Me:**  Told you so!
