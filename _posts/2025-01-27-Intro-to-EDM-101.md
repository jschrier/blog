Notes from taking [David Shimel's EDM Production Class](https://open.substack.com/pub/fractaluniversity/p/david-shimel-on-edm-production) at [Fractal University](https://fractalnyc.com/university)...

Yes, I am temporarily renouncing [my former disdain for DAWs]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2023-05-20-Autodidact-guide-to-electronic-music %}) to learn [Ableton Live](https://www.ableton.com/en/live/).


# Lesson 1: Beats 

**Homework:**

- Review: [Video: 4 Ways to make Drum Beats in Ableton (Beginner Tutorial)](https://youtu.be/Xmxudicznug)
    - There's another way to add MIDI tracks: Hold down keys (or on keyboard) and press right arrow to add. (Saw this in a video somewhere, and it is conveneint)  
- Make an account on SoundCloud. 
- Pick a few (EDM) songs and recreate their drum beats. 
    - Target: [Destiny (Instrumental Mix) by Hieroglyphix](https://music.apple.com/us/album/destiny-instrumental-mix/595799814?i=595799822)
    - [Output](https://on.soundcloud.com/Azr7qMsSCNLu2xjw5)  


 - Did some practice tutorials on [DnB construction](https://www.attackmagazine.com/technique/beat-dissected/raw-drum-bass/) 

# Lesson 2: Bass and Song Structure

Some [technology](https://www.ableton.com/en/manual/live-audio-effect-reference/)-- Ableton audio effects: 
- Compressor: Sidechaining
- Utility: Drop out on the kick (while still keeping the sidechaining alive). [history of sidechaining](https://www.ableton.com/en/blog/sidechain-compression-part-1/#:~:text=It%20may%20shock%20you%20to,the%20specific%20sibilant%20sounds%20appeared.)
- Install: [Vital VST](http://vital.audio) soft-synth. You'll need to enable Apple and VST plugs in your Ableton settings to use it as a MIDI instrument.
    - Arguably, you could do this with the built-in [Ableton Drift](https://www.ableton.com/en/blog/drift-exploring-the-new-synth-in-live-113/)
- Autofilter (high pass/low pass): simulates analog filters of various kinds

- Using the Vital VST as a sub bass. Sine F0/F1 is a common choice. Rolling bassline of 16th notes with fast decay.  Up octaves or fifths on some alternating notes to create variety. Use sidechaining on the kicks to avoid interference of the kick and the bass.

-  Structure around 16-32 measure drops: High Energy part

- Review: [Video: Drum Loops to Drops](https://youtu.be/5JFz6jfkxmA )
Think about a mood or verbal cues for sound selection ("tennis court" leans towards bouncing ball patterns)


**Homework**

- Make a 32-bar drop with drums and bass in any style you want using the techniques demonstrated in class:
    - **Output**:  [Raga to a Hip Hop Beet (after Lalit)](https://soundcloud.com/dj-borscht/ragas-to-a-hip-hop-beet-after-lalit)
    - **Inspired by** [Charanjit Singh, Lalit](https://music.apple.com/us/album/lalit/1771424058?i=1771424347), from *10 Ragas to a Disco Beat*

- Find some video clips from social media, movies/TV, your camera roll, etc. where someone is talking. We'll use these as the basis for a remix in our next session:
    - [DJT: India has never had a better friend than me](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/mN8msgdZMJY)
    - [Bonnie M: But when his drinking and lusting and his hunger for power became known to more and more people, the demands to do something about this outrageous man became louder and lounder (2:37)](https://music.apple.com/us/album/rasputin/553356934?i=553356946)
    - [DJT: We need Greenland for national security purposes](https://youtu.be/i6tU1PPQbKg?si=Fkzyrul9KZ5Af1hI&t=67)
    - [JFK: I do not regard the first man in space as a weaking of the free world, but I do regard the total mobilization of men and things for the communist block as a great danger to us.](https://youtu.be/EBeyA010HIg?si=F5iu1UnuG37GSV0B&t=2163)
    - [DJT (Inauguration): "We will measure our success not only by the battles we win but also by the wars that we end---and perhaps most importantly the wars we never get into." (21:09)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFvLorAL5-8)
    - [Melania interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NtrG0YS_88)

# Lesson 3:

**Review of Last Week's Homework tracks**
- Some initial clicking in transients can arise from very fast attacks (programmed waveform change is faster than phsyical response of speakers); you can remove this by increasing the attack time
- Some common patterns:  (i) Start with a bassline theme and then bring in the beat; (ii) How to end?  If you want DJs to play it, you would create an outtro of drums (16-32 bars) so they have time to mix it into the next one (this is an alternative to fade-outs). (ii) Impact sound effect transition into some type of break/bridge section; (iii) Crash symbals;
- Song-writing tips: Think of your song as a movie (are you starting in the middle of the action or is there a build up?) (end with the credits)

- Instagram to MP3 (many websites exist)

- Reverse reverb lead up: 100% wet, no filter

- [Download Tool: xfer rcords OTT multiband compressor (freeware install)](https://xferrecords.com/freeware)
    - Psychoacoutstic: You can hear midrange sound at lower volume. If you turn up the low and high frequencies and lower the midrange, it can sound louder. ([smiley face EQ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smiley_face_curve))
- [Download Tool: Kilohearts Essentials (free)](https://kilohearts.com/products/kilohearts_essentials) -- especially for EQ

- Trap example:
    - use as a combined kick and bass (in 1-shot mode, MIDI)
    - arpegiator (this is a way of not having to do repetitive 1/8 notes in the track)
    - triplet grid (Cmd-3)
    - use MIDI to do pitch modification of samples, automated sequencing
    - cymbals on downbeats
    - MIDI sampler: trigger versus gate mode

- Techno example :
    - Saturator effect (idoiomatic)
    - Audio Effect Rack
    - side chained reverb on vocal sample clips

Tropes of Trap genres:
- Speed up the hats (can automate this)
- Vocal call/response, response
- structural idea could be a leadup of vocals, before you start the repetitive portion. 

**Homework:**
- Review: [Making Techno from a Spoken Word Sample](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtqlbsKrd2A) (similar ideas as class, but in Techno instead of trap, some other effect processing. Some nice tricks on sidechaining against a reverb, setting up patches in Vital)
- Make another drop, using a vocal sample of your choosing
        - **Output**: [Greenland](https://soundcloud.com/dj-borscht/greenland)  (vocals sampled from [youtube](youtu.be/i6tU1PPQbKg?si=Fkzyrul9KZ5Af1hI) using an online [Youtube to MP3 conversion tool](http://y2mate.nu), rhythm section of [Andraean Sand Dunes](https://music.apple.com/us/album/andreaen-sand-dunes/1621823222?i=1621823589) )

# Lesson 4: Music Theory

- Upward expansion (audio technique) increase the volume of load parts of a signal - inverse of compression
- use simpler, form a group and you can add additional sounds (as a group) to fill in low end; sounds play together; control foldout allows you to transpose each sample separately

- The Super Saw:  Use "Uniosn"
    - [Reese Bass](https://splice.com/blog/reese-bass-history/) (detuned saw + sine on fundamental)
    - Trick for bass rhythym: you can sketch it out with measure long bass, and then arpegiate it

- Recording MIDI tracks: You may want to check the [driver error compensation](https://help.ableton.com/hc/en-us/articles/115000234830-Driver-Error-Compensation-FAQ) when recording against live tracks to avoid being off; quantization 
- Song structure: Call and response: duplicate the lead, play it back on a different sound
- A way to add energy is to open up filters that you had low-passed-away earlier.

**Homework:**
- Review: [Basic Music Theory for EDM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Hva3mvc-XM)
- Take a song that you like with a clear melody you can sing along to. Figure out the chord progression. Make a little 16-32 bar loop remix/cover

# Lesson 5: Build ups / Automation

**Review of homework**
- [Ableton can convert audio to MIDI](https://www.ableton.com/en/manual/converting-audio-to-midi/)...but alas, not the intro or lite versions

**EDM tropes:** 
- Power of two snare hits: 2 measures of quarters, 2 measures of 8ths...2 measures of 16ths.  With a second track of oscillating velocity snare 16ths. 
- Trope of an automated pitch bend up and back on the midi snare tracks. 
- Washout with a ramped reverb. 
- Whitenoise riser with bandpass filter automation.
- Play a snippet of the main melody in the buildup (a few notes from the beginning). Take smaller pieces, played more often as you approach the drop. Use delay and reverb to fill in the gaps. 
- Master channel: Put a utility that will lower the volume towards the end (zero when the drop hits and zero at the beginning of the build up maybe just -2 dB...you want it not to be directly perceptible, but it makes the jump sound lounder)
- Warping audio clips (shortens time, keeps pitch fixed)

**Homework**
- Review: [Intro to EDM Buildups](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8eITssgHtQ)
- Create a 16-32 bar drop in any style. 
    - Make sure it has a hook/main theme such as a melody or vocal sample. If you need inspiration, you can pick another song you like that has a strong melody and make a cover of it.
    - Then add an 8 bar buildup before the drop by applying the techniques we learned in class. Don’t forget to tease the hook so the listener is primed for it when it drops.

- [Gestolen Cirkel](https://geslotencirkel.bandcamp.com) via [Ableton demo](https://www.ableton.com/en/blog/gesloten-cirkel-free-tools-and-tips-for-spicing-up-sounds/)

- Charanjit Singh, [Ten Ragas to a Disco Beat](https://www.hiphopelectronic.com/no-daw-its-old-school-bangers/experimental-house-music-songs-charanjit-singh-raga-bhairavi) the spiritual forefather to acid house music.  Love it.

- [Actress: Ascending](https://youtu.be/8F-v9RZt1Z8) neat use of compressor sidechaining; the melody is sidechained to a kick that is not audibly played.  Four on the floor, hold the drums!

- [Carbon Based Lifeforms](https://music.apple.com/us/artist/carbon-based-lifeforms/26115139) satisfies my appeal for space music.

- [Drexicya](https://music.apple.com/us/artist/drexciya/5210243) not really a "new" discovery, but increased appreciation for 808 drum machine minimalism exemplefied by [Andraean Sand Dunes](https://music.apple.com/us/album/andreaen-sand-dunes/1621823222?i=1621823589).
