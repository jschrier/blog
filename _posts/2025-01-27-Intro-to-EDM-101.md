Notes from taking [David Shimel's EDM Production Class](https://open.substack.com/pub/fractaluniversity/p/david-shimel-on-edm-production) at [Fractal University](https://fractalnyc.com/university)...

Yes, I am temporarily renouncing [my former disdain for DAWs]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2023-05-20-Autodidact-guide-to-electronic-music %}) to learn [Ableton Live](https://www.ableton.com/en/live/).


# Lesson 1: Beats 

**Homework:**

- Review: [Video: 4 Ways to make Drum Beats in Ableton (Beginner Tutorial)](https://youtu.be/Xmxudicznug)
    - There's another way to add MIDI tracks: Hold down keys (or on keyboard) and press right arrow to add. (Saw this in a video somewhere, and it is conveneint)  
- Make an account on SoundCloud. 
- Pick a few (EDM) songs and recreate their drum beats. 
    - Target: [Destiny (Instrumental Mix) by Hieroglyphix](https://music.apple.com/us/album/destiny-instrumental-mix/595799814?i=595799822)
    - [Output](https://on.soundcloud.com/Azr7qMsSCNLu2xjw5)  


 - Did some practice tutorials on [DnB construction](https://www.attackmagazine.com/technique/beat-dissected/raw-drum-bass/) 

# Lesson 2: Bass and Song Structure

- Review: [Video: Drum Loops to Drops](https://youtu.be/5JFz6jfkxmA )
Think about a mood or verbal cues for sound selection ("tennis court" leans towards bouncing ball patterns)

Install 

Sub bass:  Sine F0/F1 is a common choice

Sidechain to avoid interference of the kick and the bass

Rolling bassline of 16th notes with fast decay.  Up octaves or fifths on some alternating notes 

Drops: 16-32 measures : High Energy part

Exercise: 4 on the flour kick + bass + snare.  
Progression to 

Some [technology](https://www.ableton.com/en/manual/live-audio-effect-reference/)-- Ableton audio effects: 
- Compressor: Sidechaining
- Utility: Drop out on the kick (while still keeping the sidechaining alive). [history of sidechaining](https://www.ableton.com/en/blog/sidechain-compression-part-1/#:~:text=It%20may%20shock%20you%20to,the%20specific%20sibilant%20sounds%20appeared.)
- Add on: [Vital VST](http://vital.audio) soft-synth. You'll need to enable Apple and VST plugs in your Ableton settings to use it as a MIDI instrument.
- Autofilter (high pass/low pass): simulates analog filters of various kinds

Homework: Bass and drops situation. Go.

# Resources

- [VocalRemover.org](https://vocalremover.org/splitter-ai): AI tools for removing vocals, splitting tracks into music/bass/drums, BPM finder, 

- [(free online) StemSplitter](https://voice.ai/tools/stem-splitter)

- [Ishkur's guide to electronic music](https://music.ishkur.com/) -- opinionated and hilarious, but a good way to track down genres and subgenre examples

- [The Only drum design tutorial you'll ever need](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WFGs91vSpIw)
    - Kick:  Sinewave with downward frequency and downward amplitude envelope functions. Maybe put a low-pass filter at 20 Hz. (But we kind )


# New music I discovered (and liked) during the process

- [Gestolen Cirkel](https://geslotencirkel.bandcamp.com) via [Ableton demo](https://www.ableton.com/en/blog/gesloten-cirkel-free-tools-and-tips-for-spicing-up-sounds/)

- Charanjit Singh, [Ten Ragas to a Disco Beat](https://www.hiphopelectronic.com/no-daw-its-old-school-bangers/experimental-house-music-songs-charanjit-singh-raga-bhairavi) the spiritual forefather to acid house music

- [13th Ward Social Club](https://13thwardsocialclub.bandcamp.com), e.g., [Aprismo (2025)](https://music.apple.com/us/album/aprismo/1787815444). 

- [Virtual Riot: I Heard You Like Polyrhythms](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SthcxWPXG_E&t=11s)

- [Actress: Ascending](https://youtu.be/8F-v9RZt1Z8) neat use of compressor sidechaining; the melody is sidechained to a kick that is not audibly played.  Four on the floor, hold the drums!
