A course for non-math majors on optimization and its role in hot- and cold-wars.  Students will learn  elementary aspects of mathematical optimization, with a special focus on linear programming, as viewed through the historical developments of WWII and the Cold War,  and do some relevant calculations in Mathematica. **Reading lists to include...**

# Required Reading:

* Francis Spufford, [Red Plenty](https://amzn.to/3D5TT6z) --- a novel about the Soviet planned economy
* Paul Nahin, [When Least is Best](https://amzn.to/3Wn0ctq) --- narrative mathematics about optimization topics methods
* *A book about Operations Research during WWII?*  Maybe Malcom Gladwell's [Bomber Mafia](https://amzn.to/3kwvGjt), despite qualms? Would really like engage Paul Samuelson and Abraham Wald during the WWII effort and the rise of Operations Research in the post-war US. Maybe Alex Abella's [Soldiers of Reason: The RAND Corporation and the Rise of the American Empire](https://amzn.to/3wkcrfw)
* *Miscellaneous articles from old operations research journals?*
* Thie & Keogh, [An Introduction to Linear Programming and Game Theory](https://amzn.to/3DtZ8NV) --- might be a good combo text; emphasis on graphical methods and use of excel, which we would supplement with a treatment in Mathematica


# Optional readings

* H. Paul Williams, [Mathematical Programming](https://amzn.to/3kAek5m) ---  A solid introduction to optimization ("programming") topics and their applications for newcomers
* Robert Bosch, [Opt Art](https://amzn.to/3HkB4PJ) --- introduction to linear optimization and its applications to creating mathematical art
* Presh Talwar, [The Joy of Game Theory](https://amzn.to/3ZXPFrt) --- essays about game theory topics for a popular audience
* Ken Binmore, [Playing for Real: A Text on Game Theory](https://amzn.to/3iXl7Wk) --advanced undergraduate course on game theory for economists and social scientists
