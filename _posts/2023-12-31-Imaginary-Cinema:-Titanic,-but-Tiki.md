*Premise:*  Remake [Titanic]((https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Titanic_(1997_film))), but as a [Tiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiki_culture)-themed animated movie (inspired over Mai Tais at [Bahi Hut](https://www.bahihut.com), which alleges to be Florida's oldest tiki bar)... 

That's it. Think about it. (See also the prequels in this trilogy: [Titanic, but with Manatees]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2023-12-26-Imaginary-Cinema:-Titanic,-but-with-Manatees %}) and [Titanic, but with Chiguiros]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2023-03-04-Imaginary-Cinema:-Titanic-but-with-Chiguiros %}))

**GPT4: What are the visual motifs that are characteristic of tiki artwork?**

Tiki artwork, associated with the Polynesian-themed Tiki culture that became popular in the United States after World War II, is characterized by a number of distinctive visual motifs. These motifs draw inspiration from the art and culture of the South Pacific, particularly from Polynesian, Melanesian, and Hawaiian sources. Key visual motifs characteristic of Tiki artwork include:

1. Tiki Statues: Perhaps the most iconic motif, these are stylized representations of human figures, often carved from wood or stone. They frequently feature exaggerated facial features, such as large, wide eyes, prominent nostrils, and a strong jawline or a mouth displaying teeth.

2. Exotic Flora: Tropical flowers such as hibiscus, birds of paradise, and orchids are commonly depicted in Tiki art. Palm leaves and bamboo are also typical motifs that evoke the lush landscapes of the South Pacific.

3. Ocean Elements: Symbols and imagery related to the ocean are prevalent, including waves, fish, sea turtles, and other marine life. This reflects the seafaring heritage of Polynesian cultures.

4. Volcanoes and Fire: Imagery of volcanoes and fire references the natural landscape of many Pacific islands and the importance of fire in Polynesian rituals.

5. Wood Grain and Carving Patterns: Tiki artwork often incorporates the texture of wood grain and patterns that mimic traditional Polynesian carving techniques.

6. Weapons and Tools: Traditional Polynesian weapons like spears, clubs (such as the Ma-ori mere or patu), and paddles can be depicted in Tiki art.

7. Polynesian Gods and Mythology: Various deities from Polynesian mythologies are often represented or alluded to in Tiki artwork.

8. Nautical Elements: Anchors, ropes, and other nautical items pay homage to the maritime culture of the South Pacific.

9. Thatched Roofs and Huts: Representations of traditional Pacific Islander huts with thatched roofs add to the exotic ambiance.

10. Retro Fonts and Signage: The mid-century modern period when Tiki culture flourished is also echoed in the distinctive retro typography used in Tiki bar signage and menus.

11. Sunsets and Scenic Vistas: Artistic depictions of sunsets, island vistas, and beach scenes set the mood for Tiki-themed environments.

12. Animals: Exotic animals like parrots, toucans, and monkeys are often featured in Tiki art to emphasize the tropical setting.

13. Cultural Artifacts: Canoes, tikis (carved wooden figures), tapa cloth designs, and other cultural artifacts underline the Polynesian influence.

These motifs combine in various ways to create an escapist fantasy atmosphere that is both exotic and nostalgic, evoking a romanticized version of the South Pacific islands. Tiki artwork is often found in Tiki bars, restaurants, and at themed events, as well as in fashion, home decor, and collectibles associated with the Tiki subculture.

**GPT4: Outline 10 key scenes in a hypothetical movie that remakes the movie "Titanic" but with a tiki theme.  Describe the visual aspects of the scene and the characters that are present, especially the tiki motifs, but do not include any proper names**

1. The Grand Departure: The scene opens at a vibrant, Polynesian-themed port where a massive tiki-inspired cruise liner is about to embark. Characters wear tropical attire, with lei garlands around their necks. The ship itself is adorned with tiki statues, thatched awnings, and bamboo trimmings. Passengers are greeted by crew members in Hawaiian shirts as they board the ship, with ukulele music playing in the background.

2. First-Class Luau: The elite passengers attend a luxurious luau on the top deck of the ship, surrounded by tiki torches and exotic flowers. A central character, dressed in an elegant, tropical-patterned dress or shirt, catches the eye of another across the crowded deck. The tables are set with pineapples and coconuts, and the stage features traditional Polynesian dancers and fire performers.

3. Below Decks Party: In contrast to the opulent luau, a more raucous party takes place below decks where the crew and less affluent passengers enjoy a festive atmosphere with makeshift decorations resembling a tiki bar, complete with carved tiki mugs and tropical drinks. The music is lively, with drums and island rhythms, as characters dance and mingle freely.

4. Midnight Rendezvous: Two characters sneak away to a secluded part of the ship that's been transformed into a moonlit tiki garden, complete with water features, stone tiki idols, and lush vegetation. They share a moment of intimacy under the stars with the soft glow of tiki torches illuminating their faces.

5. The Prophecy: A character with knowledge of Polynesian lore tells a tale of an ancient curse in a dimly lit room filled with artifacts and tapa cloth wall hangings. Tiki masks line the walls, casting eerie shadows as the storyteller warns of impending doom, using carved bone tools for emphasis.

6. Iceberg Sighting: A sharp contrast to the warm tiki aesthetics, the crew spots an iceberg from the crow's nest, which is adorned with Polynesian carvings. The cold, blue hues of the iceberg clash with the warm, orange light from the tiki torches on deck. Characters rush to react as panic begins to set in.

7. Chaos Ensues: As water floods into the lower levels of the ship, characters scramble to save precious tiki artifacts and navigate through corridors lined with bamboo and Polynesian motifs. The once vibrant tiki bar becomes a chaotic mess as passengers and crew work together to avoid disaster.

8. The Sacrifice: In an attempt to appease the gods and change their fate, a group of characters performs a ritual around a large tiki statue in the ship's grand hall, now tilted and filling with water. They offer gifts of flowers and fruit, but their efforts are in vain as the situation worsens.

9. The Lifeboats: Characters help others into lifeboats that are decorated with carved wooden figures and thatched coverings. The night sky serves as a backdrop to the flickering lights on the lifeboats as they're lowered into the dark, ominous sea.

10. The Aftermath: Survivors float amidst wreckage adorned with tiki motifs, awaiting rescue as dawn breaks. Driftwood, pieces of thatched material, and broken tiki carvings litter the sea around them. A somber mood prevails as characters reflect on their experience while wrapped in blankets that bear Polynesian patterns.

These scenes blend the tragic narrative of the original story with a visually rich tiki aesthetic, creating a unique and culturally infused reinterpretation of the classic film.
