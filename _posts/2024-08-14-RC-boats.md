Why [fly]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2024-02-16-3d-printed-RC-airplanes %}), when you can rule the sea? I love a good maritime theme, and always thought the [model sailboats in Central Park](https://www.centralpark.com/things-to-do/sports/model-sailboats/) were cool (in fact, they even have their own [yacht club](http://www.cpmyc.org) that races Saturdays 10am - 1pm). Possible resources for 3d-printing radio-controlled boats...
