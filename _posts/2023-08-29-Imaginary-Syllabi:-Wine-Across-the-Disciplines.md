**Premise:** A senior capstone course[^1] in which wine is explored through the lens of a variety of natural science, social science, and humanity disciplines (along with a weekly wine tasting) **Topics include...**

*In memoriam:* [Robert Germany (1974-2017)](https://www.haverford.edu/college-communications/news/robert-germany-1974â€“2017), Associate Professor of Classics at Haverford College initiated this idea over many evening conversations (with a few glasses of wine). We never got past talking about it with colleagues, but I like to think that we would have pulled it off one day.

There's clearly a shadow curriculum here, which is teaching students how to know enough to go to business meetings, fundraisers, etc. and schmooze about wine.

# Organization and Logistics

- Students will be in their final semester of their senior (fourth) year, and presumably of legal drinking age to enroll.
- Course meets once a week during a semester (13-15 weeks of instruction) for 3 hours/week.  The first 2/3 of each session is a seminar-style discussion; the last third is a structured wine tasting.
- Recruit approximately a dozen faculty members, each of whom will prepare readings and give and lead the discussion/tastings.  
- Deans and Provosts have a hard time budgeting team-taught courses, even worse if you have a dozen instructors.  So instead, we'll expect each instructor to teach a single class *pro bono*, but with the understanding that they get to take home a case of wine (and assortment from the tastings throught the semester) as compensation.
- Midterm: Students will propose and pitch a topical idea keeping in the theme of the course (how wine relates to their major)
- Final: Students will prepare readings and discussion materials about wine and some topic related to their major (which can serve as a database for future topics in the course)

    - Kepler's [Nova stereometria doliorum vinariorum](https://maa.org/press/periodicals/convergence/kepler-the-volume-of-a-wine-barrel-keplers-nova-stereometria-doliorum-vinariorum), e.g., as treated in Paul Nahin's [When Least is Best:How Mathematicians Discovered Many Clever Ways to Make Things as Small (or as Large) as Possible](https://amzn.to/3sH6f3n) 
    - [Niccolo Tartaglia's wine-dilution problem](https://puzzling.stackexchange.com/questions/28776/turning-wine-into-water/28781) from "General Trattato di Numeri" (1556) 
    - *I was inspired to add these topics after seeing the example of * determining the pH of a sample of pinot noir with a noisy pH meter in [Cory Simon's recent tutorial on Bayesian inverse problems](https://doi.org/10.1063/5.0154773)

# Example tasting topics ("labs")

- Basic wine lingo and etiquette (glassware, red/white, dry/sweet, slurp and spit, don't swallow, ... )
- Varietal distinctions (a couple sessions)
- Old world versus new world winemaking styles
- Learning to distinguish cheap wine from decent wine
- Get a [wine-flaw kit](https://www.lenez.com/en/kits/wine/faults) and use it to teach students to identify the different flaws  
- Illustrate lecture topics as needed (e.g., terroir by comparison tasting )
- Demonstrate psychological experiments (most people can't tell the difference between red and white wine when blinded, evaluate these wines based on price)
