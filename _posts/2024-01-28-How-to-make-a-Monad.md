*"[Monad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monadology)" is probably the best-known entry in the [Leibnizian lexicon](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/leibniz/). But what is a monad? A monad is a mind, but mind as understood in a particular way. Or rather, it is mind a understood in a multiplicity of distinct though related ways. In the spirit of Leibnizian tinkering, we shall learn to grasp the concept of the monad through the practical process of trying to build one. What follows, then, is a set of assembly instructions. Fortunately, monads can be constructed with materials easily found around the home. In fact, all you need is pencil, paper, and infinite, godlike intelligence. Let's get started!*  --- Richard Halpern, [Leibnizing: A Philosopher in Motion (2023)](https://amzn.to/3SAIzrb), p.88
