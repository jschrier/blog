The [first-generation claude-light](https://doi.org/10.1063/5.0266757) requires the builder to hand-solder components on prototyping board, and provides no case or housing to organize the components. **Towards the goal of simplifying and standardizing construction, we present a solderless, snap-together modification...**


# Bill of Materials

- [Raspberry Pi 4b (8gb)](https://www.adafruit.com/product/4564) --- although realistically, less memory would be fine.  Should be [available until 2034](https://endoflife.date/raspberry-pi)
- SD card for the Pi.  I had a 16GB one left over from the Jubilee build
- [Passive Heat sink](https://www.adafruit.com/product/3082) --- 
- [USB-C power supply](https://www.adafruit.com/product/5801), any will do 
- [Qwiic Pi Hat](https://www.adafruit.com/product/4688)
- [Modulino Pixels](https://amzn.to/4lUfLp4) --- [discussed in previous post]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2025-08-01-Qwiic-RGB-LEDs %})
- [AS7341 breakout board](https://www.adafruit.com/product/4698)
- **Two (2)** STEMMA/QWIIC cables...any length will suffice, [100mm is fine](https://www.adafruit.com/product/4210)
- [Arducam autofocus camera](https://amzn.to/4fZadrY)
- Some PLA filament for 3d printing

# Physical assembly

1. Print the case file on your 3d-printer (TODO) --- default settings are fine, use autogenerated supports for the overhangs. 
2. Slide the PCBs into the required slots and attach QWIIC cables from each port to each device
3. [Attach the Raspberry Pi camera](https://www.raspberrypi.com/documentation/accessories/camera.html)

# Software setup

1. Install [Raspberry Pi Lite OS](https://www.raspberrypi.com/documentation/computers/getting-started.html#installing-the-operating-system) on the SD card (go to the "other" tab and install the 64-bit Lite OS).  Apply **customization rules** to configure WiFi, enable SSH, add create default user and hostnames.
2. Plug the SD card into your Pi and boot it up. Then login via SSH.
3. Turn on I2C: `sudo raspi-config`
4. Update the OS and install necessary libraries
```
sudo apt update 
sudo apt full-upgrade 
sudo apt clean
sudo apt install python3-dev python3-setuptools
sudo apt install -y python3-picamera2 --no-install-recommends 
sudo apt install python3-simplejpeg 
sudo apt install git
```
5. Create a python virtual environment: `python -m venv --system-site-packages .venv` 
6. Edit `.bashrc` (e.g., `pico .bashrc`) and add the following line at the end of the file to load this environment on login `source ~/.venv/bin/activate`
7. Install python dependencies:
```
pip install sysv_ipc
pip install retry
pip install git+git://github.com/jkitchin/claude-light
```
8. **Replace** '~/claude-light/claude/app.py` with this [alternate file](https://gist.github.com/jschrier/131f4741202a30edf7c8ba3b3a3c3f16) (which substitutes direct PWM control of the LEDs for I2C-based control of the Modulino LED array, but otherwise only minimally changes the original  )

9. Continue with the network service setup instructions and port-forwarding (as desired), as [described on the claude-light setup documentation](https://github.com/jkitchin/claude-light/tree/main?tab=readme-ov-file#setup-claude-as-a-service)

# Dead Ends and Roads not travelled

- I scavenged an old Raspberry Pi 2B v1.1; installed headless (lite) 32-bit OS (Debian Bookwork, released 2025-05-13), but had some trouble installing some of the python dependencies.
- I initially tried the [mini QWIIC shim](https://www.sparkfun.com/sparkfun-qwiic-shim-for-raspberry-pi.html) but and while this made a nice press fit on the Pi 2B, it was too loose to make a good connection on the Pi 4B; I'm not alone on this, judging by the comments.
