Learning resources about chaos, especially chaotic electrical circuits and synthesizers...

* [Chaotic Circuits](https://www.chaotic-circuits.com) 
* [Chaos Theory for Synthesizers](http://ijfritz.byethost4.com/Chaos/ch_over.htm)--includes some "EZ circuits"
* [The Chaos Hypertextbook](https://hypertextbook.com/chaos/) more mathy
* [Complexity Explorer](https://www.complexityexplorer.org/courses) online courses information from the Santa Fe institute
* [Chua's Circuit](http://www.chuacircuits.com/howtobuild1.php) -- a whole website dedicated to the canonical chaotic electrical circuit

# Addendum (09 May 2023): Chaotic synths

* [Harnessing Chaos: the Legacy of Rob Hordijk's Benjolin](https://www.perfectcircuit.com/signal/rob-hordijk-benjolin)---has some nice walktrhough videos and biographical information and design philosophy of the inventor of the [Blippoo Box](https://sdiy.info/wiki/Rob_Hordijk_Blippoo_Box) and [Benjolin](https://sdiy.info/wiki/Rob_Hordijk_Benjolin). He had an open-source/DIY mentality. The idea was to create chaotic circuits with a wide range of "playable" settings
* [Rob Hordijk Design](https://sdiy.info/wiki/Rob_Hordijk_Design)--discussion and links to lectures
