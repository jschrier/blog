I've never understood the fascination with pottery wheels---it seems labor intensive and imprecise. I also limits you to things that have cylindrical symmetry (although I suppose you could use a mechanical lathing mechanism like in wood turning...). Instead, **I'm much more interested in [slip casting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slip_casting)...**

# Books

- Martin, [The Essential Guide to Mold Making and Slip Casting](https://amzn.to/46nUZGM)

# Youtube videos

A great discovery that I made during this exploration was the [VanTiki youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@vantikistudio).  Who knew that you could [make a small business out of custom tiki mugs](https://vantiki.com)?  But in addition, he has a great series of explanations

- [How Slipcasting Works](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tU6sBD9r_I) (19:20) -- clear explanation of the process at a microscopic and macroscopic level
    - Part of the [Ceramic and Slip Casting How ToPlaylist](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLVz2HhcJdyqhu-FK2MizsomT6AWiT-Dvm&si=csjNH-t1yviOIhD0) which provides an overveiw of making slip, the above video, and mold making
    - He's also got a super detailed, multi-hour 7 part series on making a slipcast mug from start to production. [Start here...](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JX84i2L2d5k&t=14s)

# Just want to try the process?

- Just getting started and don't want to design an object.  Just use a [silicone baking mold](https://www.oldforgecreations.co.uk/blog/silicone-baking-moulds-for-plaster-casting) and you can jump directly to some elementary plaster mold making and slipcasting.

# But what about 3d-printing?

- You can use your FDM printer to make the postives for your slipcasting projects!
    - [Example of making a positive then casting in plaster](https://claybucket.com/3d-printed-and-slipcast-cup/) --- one thing that is important is to sand your positive model to get rid of the layer lines; you can also spray with laquer/polyurethane for additional smoothing 
- Or even cooler---you can make a mold for the plaster directly(!)â€”just make the design, along with the indexing notches and be done with it; no need for cottle boards, etc. 
    - [Example mug](https://community.ceramicartsdaily.org/topic/37386-3d-printing-for-plaster-molds/)---print an exterior form into which you pour the plaster which will form the typical two part mold.
    - [Example ear cup mug](https://www.instructables.com/3D-Printing-a-Mold-for-a-Mold/) --- the idea here to to make a cylindrical vase-mode style mold into which you will pour the plaster; print without top and bottom. In the end, you destroy the 3d print to release the plaster.  
    - In either case, the basic workflow in F360 is to make your postive model, then subtract it from the mold housing, then use a plane to cut the housing, then add indexing notches for aligning the two pieces.
- In either case, just use good old fashioned Murphy's Oil Soap as the mold release


# Other resources

- [IUS Ceramics](https://claybucket.com) -- website with many resources on ceramics and glazing, including casting
- [Colorado School of Mines](https://www.mines.edu/academics/program/ceramic-engineering/) and [Alfred University](https://www.alfred.edu/academics/colleges-schools/college-ceramics/) (about 5 hours north of NYC) offer degree programs in ceramic engineering

# Parerga and Paralipomena

- [Slab casting](https://hackaday.com/2023/12/20/slab-casting-a-new-way-to-combine-3d-printing-and-ceramics/) is another way in which you 3d print the (negative) mold, coat the mold in cornstarch, then press in clay and let it dry...no plaster mold required.
