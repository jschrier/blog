An article in [today's New York Times about the destruction of church bells during World War II (and subsequent rebuilding)](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/12/27/arts/nazis-church-bells-ww2.html) and its effect on music creates an idea for a **class exploring the metallurgy and production of bells...**

# Possible activities

(in no particular order)

- Complete [METAL: Casting](https://www.metalforamerica.org/online-training/) online course work 
- Lab: Do some practical casting
    - (Probably feasible to do this as a lost-PLA type process, bell metal seems like it is not particularly high temperature, and even aluminum bells might be OK)
    - Field Trip: [Visit a local bronze foundry](https://exnyfoundry.com) or [one up in Newburgh](https://www.newyorkartfoundryinc.com)
- Lab: [Chladni plate visualizations](https://www.arborsci.com/products/mechanical-wave-valuepack) --- standing waves on a flat plate surface
- Computer: Sound analysis with Fourier-transform, etc.
- Computer: Simulating the sound of bells [with an (simulated) analog synthesizer](https://www.soundonsound.com/techniques/synthesizing-bells) or [write some DSP programs](https://www.dafx.de/papers/DAFX02_Karjalainen_Valimaki_Esquef_bell-like_sounds.pdf)
- Computer:  Finite element simulation of a bell (direct simulation of physical process?)
- Visit:  [Metropolitan Museum Bells](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:Bells_in_the_Metropolitan_Museum_of_Art) (including Chinese bronzes) --- [direct link to Met Collection query](https://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search?material=Bells)
