[AlphaMOS sells a FET-based electric tongue](https://www.alpha-mos.com/taste-analysis-astree-electronic-tongue), which you can use for [wine-quality determination](https://www.hackster.io/news/an-e-tongue-that-whines-about-bad-wine-bd9cc0c50111) (advance prediction of spoilage) **What can it do?...**


They claim:

*Based on a technology of ChemFET liquid sensors and a conductivity measurement, the electronic tongue evaluates the taste of products. This analytical instrument features unique technical characteristics  to achieve unsurpassed performance in taste analysis globally and also for some taste attributes (salty, acid, umami):*
*Evaluation of taste fingerprint : the electronic tongue detects all organic and inorganic compounds responsible for taste in liquids. With hits specific data processing software based on multivariate statistics, the instrument can assess the overall taste profile, just as the human tongue does.&
*Quantitative analysis capabilities: with the electronic tongue sensors it is possible to simultaneously rank similar samples according to the intensity of salty, acid and umami attributes.*
*Objectivity of the measurement for taste analysis: the use of an instrument like the electronic tongue to assess the taste in controlled and automated conditions assures repeatable, reproducible and totally objective results&
*Rapidity and high throughput of analysis : ASTREE electronic tongue autosampler allows to automate an analysis sequence of a set of samples, with a sample analyzed every 3 minutes.*
