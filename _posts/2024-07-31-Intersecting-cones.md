I wanted to make one of those intersecting cone fidget toys. So I [followed the instructions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGfuZ1_BmUY) to make one in Fusion360. Printed at 0.2 mm layer height (outer perimeters first for better dimensional tolerance), with 0.4mm face offset tolerance, and 0.3 mm chamfers worked just fine.  No doubt you could print in place, but I made two separate prints so that they could be contrasting colors. 

Also fun:  [print-in-place hex fidget](https://thangs.com/designer/3dprintbunny/3d-model/Fexahidget%20-%20fidget%20toy-1070974)
