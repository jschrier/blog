I wanted to make one of those intersecting cone fidget toys. So I [followed the instructions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGfuZ1_BmUY) to make one in Fusion360. Printed at 0.1 mm layer height, with 0.3mm tolerances and chamfers worked just fine.  No doubt you could print in place, but I made two separate prints so that they could be contrasting colors. 

Also fun:  [print-in-place hex fidget](https://thangs.com/designer/3dprintbunny/3d-model/Fexahidget%20-%20fidget%20toy-1070974)
